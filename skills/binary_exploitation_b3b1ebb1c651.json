    "- **Code Signing** in iOS works by requiring every piece of executable code (apps, libraries, extensions, etc.) to be cryptographically signed with a certificate issued by Apple. When code is loaded, iOS verifies the digital signature against Apple\u2019s trusted root. If the signature is invalid, missing, or modified, the OS refuses to run it. This prevents attackers from injecting malicious code into legitimate apps or running unsigned binaries, effectively stopping most exploit chains that rely on executing arbitrary or tampered code.",
    "- **CoreTrust** is the iOS subsystem responsible for enforcing code signing at runtime. It directly verifies signatures using Apple\u2019s root certificate without relying on cached trust stores, meaning only binaries signed by Apple (or with valid entitlements) can execute. CoreTrust ensures that even if an attacker tampers with an app after installation, modifies system libraries, or tries to load unsigned code, the system will block execution unless the code is still properly signed. This strict enforcement closes many post-exploitation vectors that older iOS versions allowed through weaker or bypassable signature checks.",
    "- **Data Execution Prevention (DEP)** marks memory regions as non-executable unless they explicitly contain code. This stops attackers from injecting shellcode into data regions (like the stack or heap) and running it, forcing them to rely on more complex techniques like ROP (Return-Oriented Programming).",
    "- **ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)** randomizes the memory addresses of code, libraries, stack, and heap every time the system runs. This makes it much harder for attackers to predict where useful instructions or gadgets are, breaking many exploit chains that depend on fixed memory layouts.",
    "- **KASLR (Kernel ASLR)** applies the same randomization concept to the iOS kernel. By shuffling the kernel\u2019s base address at each boot, it prevents attackers from reliably locating kernel functions or structures, raising the difficulty of kernel-level exploits that would otherwise gain full system control.",
    "- **Kernel Patch Protection (KPP)** also known as **AMCC (Apple Mobile File Integrity)** in iOS, continuously monitors the kernel\u2019s code pages to ensure they haven\u2019t been modified. If any tampering is detected\u2014such as an exploit trying to patch kernel functions or insert malicious code\u2014the device will immediately panic and reboot. This protection makes persistent kernel exploits far harder, as attackers can\u2019t simply hook or patch kernel instructions without triggering a system crash.",
    "- **Kernel Text Readonly Region (KTRR)** is a hardware-based security feature introduced on iOS devices. It uses the CPU\u2019s memory controller to mark the kernel\u2019s code (text) section as permanently read-only after boot. Once locked, even the kernel itself cannot modify this memory region. This prevents attackers\u2014and even privileged code\u2014from patching kernel instructions at runtime, closing off a major class of exploits that relied on modifying kernel code directly.",
    "- **Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC)** use cryptographic signatures embedded into unused bits of pointers to verify their integrity before use. When a pointer (like a return address or function pointer) is created, the CPU signs it with a secret key; before dereferencing, the CPU checks the signature. If the pointer was tampered with, the check fails and execution stops. This prevents attackers from forging or reusing corrupted pointers in memory corruption exploits, making techniques like ROP or JOP much harder to pull off reliably.",
    "- **Privilege Access never (PAN)** is a hardware feature that prevents the kernel (privileged mode) from directly accessing user-space memory unless it explicitly enables access. This stops attackers who gained kernel code execution from easily reading or writing user memory to escalate exploits or steal sensitive data. By enforcing strict separation, PAN reduces the impact of kernel exploits and blocks many common privilege-escalation techniques.",
    "- **Page Protection Layer (PPL)** is an iOS security mechanism that protects critical kernel-managed memory regions, especially those related to code signing and entitlements. It enforces strict write protections using the MMU (Memory Management Unit) and additional checks, ensuring that even privileged kernel code cannot arbitrarily modify sensitive pages. This prevents attackers who gain kernel-level execution from tampering with security-critical structures, making persistence and code-signing bypasses significantly harder.",
