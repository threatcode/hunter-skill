    "## Understanding SAProuter Penetration with Metasploit",
    "SAProuter acts as a reverse proxy for SAP systems, primarily to control access between the internet and internal SAP networks. It's commonly exposed to the internet by allowing TCP port 3299 through organizational firewalls. This setup makes SAProuter an attractive target for penetration testing because it might serve as a gateway to high-value internal networks.",
    "**Scanning and Information Gathering**",
    "Initially, a scan is performed to identify if a SAP router is running on a given IP using the **sap_service_discovery** module. This step is crucial for establishing the presence of a SAP router and its open port.",

    "msf> use auxiliary/scanner/sap/sap_service_discovery",
    "msf auxiliary(sap_service_discovery) > set RHOSTS 1.2.3.101",
    "msf auxiliary(sap_service_discovery) > run",
    "Following the discovery, further investigation into the SAP router's configuration is carried out with the **sap_router_info_request** module to potentially reveal internal network details."
