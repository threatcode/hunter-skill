    "### Establishment of WebSocket Connections",
    "A detailed explanation on establishing WebSocket connections can be accessed [**here**](https://infosecwriteups.com/cross-site-websocket-hijacking-cswsh-ce2a6b0747fc). In summary, WebSocket connections are usually initiated via client-side JavaScript as shown below:",
    "```javascript",
    "var ws = new WebSocket(\"wss://normal-website.com/ws\")",
    "The `wss` protocol signifies a WebSocket connection secured with **TLS**, whereas `ws` indicates an **unsecured** connection.",
    "During the connection establishment, a handshake is performed between the browser and server over HTTP. The handshake process involves the browser sending a request and the server responding, as illustrated in the following examples:",
    "Browser sends a handshake request:",
    "```javascript",
    "GET /chat HTTP/1.1",
