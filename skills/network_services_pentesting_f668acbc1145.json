    "## Basic Information",
    "From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISCSI):",
    "> In computing, **iSCSI** is an acronym for **Internet Small Computer Systems Interface**, an Internet Protocol (IP)-based storage networking standard for linking data storage facilities. It provides block-level access to storage devices by carrying SCSI commands over a TCP/IP network. iSCSI is used to facilitate data transfers over intranets and to manage storage over long distances. It can be used to transmit data over local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), or the Internet and can enable location-independent data storage and retrieval.",
    "> The protocol allows clients (called initiators) to send SCSI commands (CDBs) to storage devices (targets) on remote servers. It is a storage area network (SAN) protocol, allowing organizations to consolidate storage into storage arrays while providing clients (such as database and web servers) with the illusion of locally attached SCSI disks. It mainly competes with Fibre Channel, but unlike traditional Fibre Channel which usually requires dedicated cabling, iSCSI can be run over long distances using existing network infrastructure.",

    "**Note:** You may find that when your targets are discovered, they are listed under a different IP address. This tends to happen if the iSCSI service is exposed via NAT or a virtual IP. In cases like these, `iscsiadmin` will fail to connect. This requires two tweaks: one to the directory name of the node automatically created by your discovery activities, and one to the `default` file contained within this directory."
