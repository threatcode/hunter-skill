    "A client side path traversal occurs when you can **manipulate the path of a URL** that is going to be **sent to a user to visit in a legit way** or that a user is somehow going to be **forced to visit for example via JS or CSS**. CSPT is also known as **On-Site Request Forgery (OSRF)** because it lets you coerce the victim\u2019s browser into hitting arbitrary paths on the same origin with their cookies, JWTs, or mTLS certificates.",
    "Typical sources (data you control):",
    "- Route parameters that get concatenated into `fetch()` or XHR paths (React Router, Next.js dynamic routes, Vue router params, Angular `ActivatedRoute`).",
    "- Stored values (profile slugs, document IDs) that are interpolated into paths inside background jobs, service workers, or WebSocket URLs.",
    "- UI gadgets (download/export buttons, image galleries) that append user-controlled fragments or file extensions to API endpoints before the request is dispatched.",
    "Typical sinks (where the traversal lands):",
    "- Frontend API wrappers that prepend `/api/` or `/proxy/` and reuse auth headers automatically.",
    "- `history.pushState` / `router.navigate` helpers that reconstruct URLs later during hydration.",
    "- `<link>`/`<style>`/`@import` statements generated by CMS content or feature-flag payloads.",
    "### Common impacts & chains",
    "- **CSPT \u279c CSRF/OSRF**: hijack authenticated `POST/PUT/DELETE` calls by escaping the intended resource path, then re-entering sensitive endpoints (password reset, payment approval, access revocation). Combine with the [CSRF](csrf-cross-site-request-forgery.md) checklist to escalate.",
    "- **CSPT \u279c cache deception / poisoning**: serve attacker-controlled JSON from public CDN keys and replay it unauthenticated. See [Cache Poisoning and Cache Deception](cache-deception/README.md)."
