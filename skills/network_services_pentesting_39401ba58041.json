These images are organized within **Docker repositories** in the registry, each repository storing various versions of a specific image. The functionality provided allows for images to be downloaded locally or uploaded to the registry, assuming the user has the necessary permissions.",
    "**DockerHub** serves as the default public registry for Docker, but users also have the option to operate an on-premise version of the open-source Docker registry/distribution or opt for the commercially supported **Docker Trusted Registry**. Additionally, various other public registries can be found online.",
