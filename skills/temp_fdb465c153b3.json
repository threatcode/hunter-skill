    "# Memory-Safe Programming Languages: Recommendations to Combat Buffer Overflows",
    "Buffer overflows and other memory-related vulnerabilities have long plagued software development, especially in languages like C and C++ that require manual memory management. Recognizing the risks posed by these vulnerabilities, organizations such as the National Security Agency (NSA), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and international cybersecurity bodies have strongly recommended transitioning to memory-safe programming languages. These languages are designed to mitigate common memory safety issues, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, and dangling pointers.",
    "## The Problem with Memory-Unsafe Languages",
    "Languages like C and C++ offer low-level control over memory, which is essential for performance-critical applications. However, this flexibility comes at a cost: developers must manually manage memory allocation and deallocation, making it easy to introduce vulnerabilities. Common issues include:",
    "- Buffer Overflows: Writing more data to a buffer than it can hold.",
    "- Use-After-Free Errors: Accessing memory after it has been deallocated.",
    "- Dangling Pointers: Pointers that reference invalid or deallocated memory.",
    "These vulnerabilities are frequently exploited by attackers for remote code execution, data corruption, or system compromise. For example, Google reported that 70% of severe security bugs in its products stem from memory safety issues.",
    "## Memory-Safe Programming Languages",
    "Memory-safe languages are designed to prevent such vulnerabilities by incorporating features like automatic memory management, bounds checking, and strict type systems. Here are some of the most recommended options:",
    "### 1. Rust",
    "Rust is a standout choice for system-level programming due to its ownership model, which ensures memory safety at compile time without needing garbage collection. Its strict checks prevent common issues like buffer overflows and data races.",
    "### 2. Go",
    "Go offers garbage collection and a robust standard library that minimizes manual memory management errors. It avoids pitfalls like pointer arithmetic while maintaining high performance.",
    "### 3. Java"
