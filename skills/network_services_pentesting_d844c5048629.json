    "- **DNS Root Servers**: These are at the top of the DNS hierarchy, managing the top-level domains and stepping in only if lower-level servers do not respond. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (**ICANN**) oversees their operation, with a global count of 13.",
    "- **Authoritative Nameservers**: These servers have the final say for queries in their designated zones, offering definitive answers. If they can't provide a response, the query is escalated to the root servers.",
    "- **Non-authoritative Nameservers**: Lacking ownership over DNS zones, these servers gather domain information through queries to other servers.",
    "- **Caching DNS Server**: This type of server memorizes previous query answers for a set time to speed up response times for future requests, with the cache duration dictated by the authoritative server.",
    "- **Forwarding Server**: Serving a straightforward role, forwarding servers simply relay queries to another server."
