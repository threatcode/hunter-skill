    "This is the most basic way to do some trading. You can **indicate the amount of the asset and the price** that you want to buy or sell, and whenever that price is reached the operation is done.",
    "Usually you can also use the **current market price** in order to perform the transaction as fast as possible to the current price.",
    "**Stop Loss - Limit**: You can also indicate amount and the price of the assets to buy or sell while also indicating a lower price to buy or sell in case it's reached (to stop losses).",
    "## Futures",
    "A future is a contract where 2 parts comes to an agreement to **acquire something in the future at a fixed price**. For example to sell 1 bitcoin in 6 months at 70.000$.",
    "Obviously if by 6 months the bitcoin value is 80.000$ the seller part loses money and the buying part earns it. If in 6 months the bitcoin value is 60.000$, the opposite happens.",
    "However, this is interesting for example for business which are generating a product and need to have the security that thy will be able to sell it at a price to pay the costs. Or business which want to assure fixed prices in the future for something eve if higher.",
    "Although in exchanges this is usually used to try to make a profit.",
    "* Notice that a \"Long position\" means that someone if betting that a price is going to increase",
    "* While a \"short position\" means that someone if betting that a price is going to go down",
    "### Hedging With Futures <a href=\"#mntl-sc-block_7-0\" id=\"mntl-sc-block_7-0\"></a>",
    "If a fund manager is afraid that some stocks are going to go down he might take a short position over some assets like bitcoins or S\\&P 500 futures contracts. This would be similar to buying or having some assets and create a contract of selling those at a future time at a bigger price."
