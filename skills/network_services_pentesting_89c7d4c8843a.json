    "Django cache is stored in one of four places: [Redis](https://github.com/django/django/blob/48a1929ca050f1333927860ff561f6371706968a/django/core/cache/backends/redis.py#L12), [memory](https://github.com/django/django/blob/48a1929ca050f1333927860ff561f6371706968a/django/core/cache/backends/locmem.py#L16), [files](https://github.com/django/django/blob/48a1929ca050f1333927860ff561f6371706968a/django/core/cache/backends/filebased.py#L16), or a [database](https://github.com/django/django/blob/48a1929ca050f1333927860ff561f6371706968a/django/core/cache/backends/db.py#L95). Cache stored in a Redis server or database are the most likely attack vectors (Redis injection and SQL injection), but an attacker may also be able to use file-based cache to turn an arbitrary write into RCE. Maintainers have marked this as a non-issue. It's important to note that the cache file folder, SQL table name, and Redis server details will vary based on implementation.",
    "On **FileBasedCache**, the pickled value is written to a file under `CACHES['default']['LOCATION']` (often `/var/tmp/django_cache/`). If that directory is world-writable or attacker-controlled, dropping a malicious pickle under the expected cache key yields code execution when the app reads it:",
