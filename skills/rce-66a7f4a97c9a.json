The pickle module is a frequently used tool for this in Python, as it can serialize and deserialize complex Python objects, including custom classes.\n\n## Summary\n\n* [Tools](#tools)\n* [Methodology](#methodology)\n    * [Pickle](#pickle)\n    * [PyYAML](#pyyaml)\n* [References](#references)\n\n## Tools\n\n* [j0lt-github/python-des",
