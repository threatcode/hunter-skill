    "Most car key fobs operate on either **315 MHz or 433 MHz**. These are both radio frequencies, and they are used in a variety of different applications. The main difference between the two frequencies is that 433 MHz has a longer range than 315 MHz. This means that 433 MHz is better for applications that require a longer range, such as remote keyless entry.\\",
    "In Europe 433.92MHz is commonly used and in U.S. and Japan it's the 315MHz.",
