    "Even though most business-logic in modern stacks is written in *memory-safe* languages, the underlying runtime (or third-party libraries) is eventually implemented in C/C++.  Whenever user-controlled numbers are used to allocate buffers, compute offsets, or perform length checks, **a 32-bit or 64-bit wrap-around may transform an apparently harmless parameter into an out-of-bounds read/write, a logic bypass or a DoS**.",
    "Typical attack surface:",
    "1. **Numeric request parameters** \u2013 classic `id`, `offset`, or `count` fields.",
    "2. **Length / size headers** \u2013 `Content-Length`, WebSocket frame length, HTTP/2 `continuation_len`, etc.",
    "3. **File-format metadata parsed server-side or client-side** \u2013 image dimensions, chunk sizes, font tables.",
    "4. **Language-level conversions** \u2013 signed\u2194unsigned casts in PHP/Go/Rust FFI, JS `Number` \u2192 `int32` truncations inside V8.",
    "5. **Authentication & business logic** \u2013 coupon value, price, or balance calculations that silently overflow.",
