    "### Exploring Similar Endpoints",
    "Attempts should be made to perform brute force attacks on variations of the targeted endpoint, such as `/api/v3/sign-up`, including alternatives like `/Sing-up`, `/SignUp`, `/singup`, `/api/v1/sign-up`, `/api/sign-up` etc.",
    "### Incorporating Blank Characters in Code or Parameters",
    "Inserting blank bytes like `%00`, `%0d%0a`, `%0d`, `%0a`, `%09`, `%0C`, `%20` into code or parameters can be a useful strategy. For example, adjusting a parameter to `code=1234%0a` allows for extending attempts through variations in input, like adding newline characters to an email address to get around attempt limitations.",
    "### Manipulating IP Origin via Headers",
    "Modifying headers to alter the perceived IP origin can help evade IP-based rate limiting. Headers such as `X-Originating-IP`, `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Remote-IP`, `X-Remote-Addr`, `X-Client-IP`, `X-Host`, `X-Forwared-Host`, including using multiple instances of `X-Forwarded-For`, can be adjusted to simulate requests from different IPs.",
