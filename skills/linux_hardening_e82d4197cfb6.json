    "The technique outlines a method for **executing host code from within a container**, overcoming challenges posed by storage-driver configurations that obscure the container's filesystem path on the host, like Kata Containers or specific `devicemapper` settings.",
    "Key steps:",
    "1. **Locating Process IDs (PIDs):** Using the `/proc/<pid>/root` symbolic link in the Linux pseudo-filesystem, any file within the container can be accessed relative to the host's filesystem. This bypasses the need to know the container's filesystem path on the host.",
    "2. **PID Bashing:** A brute force approach is employed to search through PIDs on the host. This is done by sequentially checking for the presence of a specific file at `/proc/<pid>/root/<file>`. When the file is found, it indicates that the corresponding PID belongs to a process running inside the target container.",
    "3. **Triggering Execution:** The guessed PID path is written to the `cgroups release_agent` file. This action triggers the execution of the `release_agent`. The success of this step is confirmed by checking for the creation of an output file.",
    "### Exploitation Process",
    "The exploitation process involves a more detailed set of actions, aiming to execute a payload on the host by guessing the correct PID of a process running inside the container. Here's how it unfolds:",
    "1. **Initialize Environment:** A payload script (`payload.sh`) is prepared on the host, and a unique directory is created for cgroup manipulation.",
    "2. **Prepare Payload:** The payload script, which contains the commands to be executed on the host, is written and made executable.",
    "3. **Set Up Cgroup:** The cgroup is mounted and configured. The `notify_on_release` flag is set to ensure that the payload executes when the cgroup is released.",
    "4. **Brute Force PID:** A loop iterates through potential PIDs, writing each guessed PID to the `release_agent` file. This effectively sets the payload script as the `release_agent`.",
    "5. **Trigger and Check Execution:** For each PID, the cgroup's `cgroup.procs` is written to, triggering the execution of the `release_agent` if the PID is correct. The loop continues until the output of the payload script is found, indicating successful execution."
