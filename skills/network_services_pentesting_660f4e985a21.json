    "## Introduction",
    "GraphQL is **highlighted** as an **efficient alternative** to REST API, offering a simplified approach for querying data from the backend. In contrast to REST, which often necessitates numerous requests across varied endpoints to gather data, GraphQL enables the fetching of all required information through a **single request**. This streamlining significantly **benefits developers** by diminishing the intricacy of their data fetching processes.",
    "## GraphQL and Security",
    "With the advent of new technologies, including GraphQL, new security vulnerabilities also emerge. A key point to note is that **GraphQL does not include authentication mechanisms by default**. It's the responsibility of developers to implement such security measures. Without proper authentication, GraphQL endpoints may expose sensitive information to unauthenticated users, posing a significant security risk.",
