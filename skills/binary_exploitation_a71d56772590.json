    "### Goal",
    "- RCE by abusing relative pointers",
    "### Requirements",
    "- Edit fastbin and unsorted bin pointers",
    "- 12 bits of randomness must be brute forced (0.02% chance) of working",
    "## Attack Steps",
    "### Part 1: Fastbin Chunk points to \\_\\_malloc_hook",
    "Create several chunks:",
    "- `fastbin_victim` (0x60, offset 0): UAF chunk later to edit the heap pointer later to point to the LibC value."
