    "### **Types of Information Security Controls**",
    "Information security controls can be broadly categorized into three main types: administrative, physical, and technical controls. Each type serves specific functions and addresses different aspects of security.",
    "#### **1. Administrative Controls**",
    "Administrative controls involve the policies, procedures, and guidelines established by an organization to manage and govern its information security. These controls are crucial for setting the tone and framework for security practices within the organization.",
    "- **Examples**: Security policies, employee training programs, incident response plans, and access control policies.",

    "#### **2. Physical Controls**",
    "Physical controls are measures taken to protect the physical infrastructure and hardware that store and process information. These controls are designed to prevent unauthorized physical access to facilities and equipment.",
    "- **Examples**: Security guards, surveillance cameras, locks, biometric access controls, and secure server rooms.",
    "- **Functions**: These controls aim to deter, detect, and prevent physical intrusions that could compromise information security",
    "#### **3. Technical Controls**",
    "Technical controls, also known as logical controls, involve the use of technology to protect information systems and data. These controls are implemented through hardware and software solutions.",
    "- **Examples**: Firewalls, antivirus software, encryption, intrusion detection systems, and multi-factor authentication."
