  "description": "# Prototype Pollution\n\n> Prototype pollution is a type of vulnerability that occurs in JavaScript when properties of Object.prototype are modified. This is particularly risky because JavaScript objects are dynamic and we can add properties to them at any time. Also, almost all objects in JavaScript inherit from Object.prototype, making it a potential attack vector.\n\n## Summary\n\n* [Tools](#tools)\n* [Methodology](#methodology)\n    * [Examples](#examples)\n    * [Manual Testing](#manual-testing)\n   ",
