    "The **AdminSDHolder** group's Access Control List (ACL) is crucial as it sets permissions for all \"protected groups\" within Active Directory, including high-privilege groups. This mechanism ensures the security of these groups by preventing unauthorized modifications.",
    "An attacker could exploit this by modifying the **AdminSDHolder** group's ACL, granting full permissions to a standard user. This would effectively give that user full control over all protected groups. If this user's permissions are altered or removed, they would be automatically reinstated within an hour due to the system's design."
