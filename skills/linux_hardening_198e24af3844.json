    "Linux capabilities divide **root privileges into smaller, distinct units**, allowing processes to have a subset of privileges. This minimizes the risks by not granting full root privileges unnecessarily.",
    "### The Problem:",
    "- Normal users have limited permissions, affecting tasks like opening a network socket which requires root access.",
    "### Capability Sets:",
    "1. **Inherited (CapInh)**:",
    "- **Purpose**: Determines the capabilities passed down from the parent process.",
    "- **Functionality**: When a new process is created, it inherits the capabilities from its parent in this set. Useful for maintaining certain privileges across process spawns.",
    "- **Restrictions**: A process cannot gain capabilities that its parent did not possess.",
    "2. **Effective (CapEff)**:",
    "- **Purpose**: Represents the actual capabilities a process is utilizing at any moment.",
    "- **Functionality**: It's the set of capabilities checked by the kernel to grant permission for various operations. For files, this set can be a flag indicating if the file's permitted capabilities are to be considered effective.",
    "- **Significance**: The effective set is crucial for immediate privilege checks, acting as the active set of capabilities a process can use."
