  "description": "# Web Sockets\n\n> WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived connection. This enables real-time, bi-directional communication between clients (typically web browsers) and servers through a persistent connection. WebSockets are commonly used for web applications that require frequent, low-latency updates, such as live chat applications, online gaming, real-time notifications, and financial trading platforms.\n\n## Summary\n\n* [Tool",
