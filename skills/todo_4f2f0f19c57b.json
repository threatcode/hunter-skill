    "### Basic Config",
    "After installing there are a few things that you could consider configuring.\\",
    "In settings (the second tab button) you can select the **SDR device** or **select a file** to read and which frequency to syntonise and the Sample rate (recommended to up to 2.56Msps if your PC support it)",
