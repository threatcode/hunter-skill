    "Key constraints and tips",
    "- Only use headers and syntax that a browser can emit via navigation, fetch, or form submission. Header obfuscations (LWS tricks, duplicate TE, invalid CL) generally won\u2019t send.",
    "- Target endpoints and intermediaries that reflect inputs or cache responses. Useful impacts include cache poisoning, leaking front-end injected headers, or bypassing front-end path/method controls.",
    "- Reuse matters: align the crafted request so it shares the same HTTP/1.1 or H2 connection as a high-value victim request. Connection-locked/stateful behaviors amplify impact.",
    "- Prefer primitives that do not require custom headers: path confusion, query-string injection, and body shaping via form-encoded POSTs.",
    "- Validate genuine server-side desync vs. mere pipelining artifacts by re-testing without reuse, or by using the HTTP/2 nested-response check.",
