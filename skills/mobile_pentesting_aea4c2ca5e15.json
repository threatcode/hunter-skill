    "`AccessibilityService` was created to help users with disabilities interact with Android devices.  Unfortunately, the same **powerful automation APIs** (global navigation, text input, gesture dispatch, overlay windows\u2026) can be weaponised by malware to gain **complete remote control** of the handset _without root privileges_.",
    "Modern Android banking Trojans and Remote-Access-Trojans (RATs) such as **PlayPraetor, SpyNote, BrasDex, SOVA, ToxicPanda** and many others follow the same recipe:",
    "1. Social-engineer the victim into enabling a rogue accessibility service (the *BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE* permission is considered \"high-risk\" and requires an explicit user action).",
    "2. Leverage the service to",
    "* capture every UI event & text that appears on screen,",
    "* inject synthetic gestures (`dispatchGesture`) and global actions (`performGlobalAction`) to automate any task the operator desires,",
    "* draw full-screen overlays on top of legitimate apps using the **TYPE_ACCESSIBILITY_OVERLAY** window type (no `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` prompt!),",
    "* silently grant additional runtime permissions by clicking on the system dialogs on the victim\u2019s behalf.",
    "3. Exfiltrate data or perform **On-Device-Fraud (ODF)** in real-time while the user is looking at a perfectly normal screen.",
    "### Packed Accessibility droppers",
    "ClayRat v3.0.8 couples its Accessibility RAT with a staged payload hidden under `assets/`. At runtime the host APK:",
    "1. Streams the encrypted blob from `assets/*.dat`."
