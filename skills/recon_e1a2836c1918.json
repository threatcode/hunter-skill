[Nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) supports scanning for various protocols, including TCP, DNS, HTTP, SSL, File, Whois, and Websocket.",
    "## Some of the Key Features",
    "1. Template-based scanning: Nuclei uses YAML-based templates to define scanning logic, making it highly extensible and customizable.",
    "2. Multi-protocol support: Enables scanning across various network protocols and services.",
    "3. Fast and efficient: Optimized for speed, allowing rapid scanning of large numbers of hosts.",
    "4. Low false positives: Template-based approach helps minimize false positive results.",
    "5. Community-driven: Large repository of community-contributed templates for detecting various vulnerabilities.",
    "6. Easy integration: Can be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines and other automated security workflows.",
    "## Usage Examples",
    "### Basic Scanning",
    "To scan a single target using Nuclei:",
    "```bash",
