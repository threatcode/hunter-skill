    "## Overview",
    "Most modern Android phones embed a Broadcom/Cypress Wi-Fi chipset that ships without 802.11 monitor mode or frame-injection capabilities.  The open-source NexMon framework patches the proprietary firmware to add those features and exposes them through a shared library (`libnexmon.so`) and a CLI helper (`nexutil`).  By pre-loading that library into the stock Wi-Fi driver, a rooted device can capture raw 802.11 traffic and inject arbitrary frames \u2013 eliminating the need for an external USB adapter.",
    "This page documents a fast workflow that takes a fully-patched Samsung Galaxy S10 (BCM4375B1) as an example, using:",
    "* NexMon Magisk module containing the patched firmware + `libnexmon.so`",
    "* Hijacker Android application to automate monitor-mode toggling",
    "* Optional Kali NetHunter chroot to run classic wireless tools (aircrack-ng, wifite, mdk4 \u2026) directly against the internal interface",
    "The same technique applies to any handset that has a publicly available NexMon patch (Pixel 1, Nexus 6P, Galaxy S7/S8, etc.).",
    "## Prerequisites",
    "* Android handset with a supported Broadcom/Cypress chipset (e.g. BCM4358/59/43596/4375B1)",
    "* Root with Magisk \u2265 24",
    "* BusyBox (most ROMs/NetHunter already include it)",
    "* NexMon Magisk ZIP or self-compiled patch providing:",
    "* `/system/lib*/libnexmon.so`"
