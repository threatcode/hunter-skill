  "description": "# Insecure Direct Object References\n\n> Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) is a security vulnerability that occurs when an application allows users to directly access or modify objects (such as files, database records, or URLs) based on user-supplied input, without sufficient access controls. This means that if a user changes a parameter value (like an ID) in a URL or API request, they might be able to access or manipulate data that they aren\u2019t authorized to see or modify.\n\n## Summary\n\n* [T",
