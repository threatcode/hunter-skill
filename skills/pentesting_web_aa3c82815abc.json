    "### Request Interception",
    "During the transaction process, it is crucial to monitor the data being exchanged between the client and the server. This can be done by intercepting all requests. Within these requests, look out for parameters with significant implications, such as:",
    "- **Success**: This parameter often indicates the status of the transaction.",
    "- **Referrer**: It might point to the source from where the request originated.",
    "- **Callback**: This is typically used for redirecting the user after a transaction is completed.",
    "### URL Analysis",
    "If you encounter a parameter that contains a URL, especially one following the pattern _example.com/payment/MD5HASH_, it requires closer examination. Here's a step-by-step approach:",
    "1. **Copy the URL**: Extract the URL from the parameter value.",
    "2. **New Window Inspection**: Open the copied URL in a new browser window. This action is critical for understanding the transaction's outcome.",
    "### Parameter Manipulation",
    "1. **Change Parameter Values**: Experiment by altering the values of parameters like _Success_, _Referrer_, or _Callback_. For instance, changing a parameter from `false` to `true` can sometimes reveal how the system handles these inputs.",
    "2. **Remove Parameters**: Try removing certain parameters altogether to see how the system reacts. Some systems might have fallbacks or default behaviors when expected parameters are missing."
