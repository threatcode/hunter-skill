    "Flipper uses a digital IR signal receiver TSOP, which **allows intercepting signals from IR remotes**. There are some **smartphones** like Xiaomi, which also have an IR port, but keep in mind that **most of them can only transmit** signals and are **unable to receive** them.",
    "The Flipper infrared **receiver is quite sensitive**. You can even **catch the signal** while remaining **somewhere in between** the remote and the TV. Pointing the remote directly at Flipper's IR port is unnecessary. This comes in handy when someone is switching channels while standing near the TV, and both you and Flipper are some distance away.",
    "As the **decoding of the infrared** signal happens on the **software** side, Flipper Zero potentially supports the **reception and transmission of any IR remote codes**. In the case of **unknown** protocols which could not be recognized - it **records and plays back** the raw signal exactly as received.",
    "## Actions",
    "### Universal Remotes",
    "Flipper Zero can be used as a **universal remote to control any TV, air conditioner, or media center**. In this mode, Flipper **bruteforces** all **known codes** of all supported manufacturers **according to the dictionary from the SD card**. You don't need to choose a particular remote to turn off a restaurant TV.",
    "It is enough to press the power button in the Universal Remote mode, and Flipper will **sequentially send \"Power Off\"** commands of all the TVs it knows: Sony, Samsung, Panasonic... and so on. When the TV receives its signal, it will react and turn off."
