    "Mach messages are sent over a _mach port_, which is a **single receiver, multiple sender communication** channel built into the mach kernel. **Multiple processes can send messages** to a mach port, but at any point **only a single process can read from it**. Just like file descriptors and sockets, mach ports are allocated and managed by the kernel and processes only see an integer, which they can use to indicate to the kernel which of their mach ports they want to use.",
