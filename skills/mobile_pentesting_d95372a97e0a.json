    "- **Share**: Enables sharing to social networks or with others directly.",
    "- **Today (Widgets)**: Delivers content or performs tasks quickly from the Notification Center's Today view.",
    "When a user engages with these extensions, such as sharing text from a host app, the extension processes this input within its context, leveraging the shared information to perform its task, as detailed in Apple's documentation.",
    "### **Security Considerations**",
    "Key security aspects include:",
    "- Extensions and their containing apps communicate via inter-process communication, not directly.",
    "- The **Today widget** is unique in that it can request its app to open via a specific method.",
    "- Shared data access is allowed within a private container, but direct access is restricted.",
    "- Certain APIs, including HealthKit, are off-limits to app extensions, which also cannot start long-running tasks, access the camera, or microphone, except for iMessage extensions.",
