    "## Introduction",
    "**Low-Power Wide Area Network** (LPWAN) is a group of wireless, low-power, wide-area network technologies designed for **long-range communications** at a low bit rate.",
    "They can reach more than **six miles** and their **batteries** can last up to **20 years**.",
    "Long Range (**LoRa**) is currently the most deployed LPWAN physical layer and its open MAC-layer specification is **LoRaWAN**.",
    "## LPWAN, LoRa, and LoRaWAN",
    "* LoRa \u2013 Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) physical layer developed by Semtech (proprietary but documented).",
    "* LoRaWAN \u2013 Open MAC/Network layer maintained by the LoRa-Alliance. Versions 1.0.x and 1.1 are common in the field.",
    "* Typical architecture: *end-device \u2192 gateway (packet-forwarder) \u2192 network-server \u2192 application-server*.",
    "> The **security model** relies on two AES-128 root keys (AppKey/NwkKey) that derive session keys during the *join* procedure (OTAA) or are hard-coded (ABP). If any key leaks the attacker gains full read/write capability over the corresponding traffic.",
