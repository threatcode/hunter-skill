    "2. **System Fingerprinting**:",
    "- **OS and Service Fingerprinting**: Using tools like **Nmap** or **Netcat**, attackers can probe systems to identify discrepancies in OS versions or service configurations that might indicate a honeypot.",
    "- **Known Signatures**: Some honeypots have identifiable signatures or configurations. Comparing system responses against known signatures can help in detection.",
    "3. **Interaction Analysis**:",
    "- **Response Patterns**: Honeypots often have scripted or automated responses. Analyzing the nature and timing of responses can reveal if the system is a honeypot.",
    "- **Behavioral Analysis**: Observing how the system behaves under different conditions. Honeypots might not handle edge cases or unusual commands as well as a real system would.",
    "4. **Honeypot-Specific Tools**:",
    "- **Honeypot Detection Tools**: Tools like **Honeyd Detector** or **Honeypot Hunter** can help in identifying honeypots by analyzing network traffic and system responses.",

    "1. **System and Environment Checks**:",
    "- **File System Analysis**: Sandboxes may have distinct file system structures or paths. Malware can check for specific directories or files commonly associated with sandbox environments."
