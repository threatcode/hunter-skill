    "For a device to participate in a NetBIOS network, it must have a unique name. This is achieved through a **broadcast process** where a \"Name Query\" packet is sent. If no objections are received, the name is considered available. Alternatively, a **Name Service server** can be queried directly to check for name availability or to resolve a name to an IP address. Tools like `nmblookup`, `nbtscan`, and `nmap` are utilized for enumerating NetBIOS services, revealing server names and MAC addresses.",
