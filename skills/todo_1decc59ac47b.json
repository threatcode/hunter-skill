    "## Introduction",
    "**Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)** is the most popular short-range radio solution. It's usually used to store and transmit information that identifies an entity.",
    "An RFID tag can rely on **its own power source (active)**, such as an embedded battery, or receive its power from the reading antenna using the current **induced from the received radio waves** (**passive**).",
    "### Classes",
    "EPCglobal divides RFID tags into six categories. A tag in each category has all the capabilities listed in the previous category, making it backward compatible.",
    "- **Class 0** tags are **passive** tags that operate in **UHF** bands. The vendor **preprograms** them at the production factory. As a result, you **can\u2019t change** the information stored in their memory.",
    "- **Class 1** tags can also operate in **HF** bands. In addition, they can be **written only once** after production. Many Class 1 tags can also process **cyclic redundancy checks** (CRCs) of the commands they receive. CRCs are a few extra bytes at the end of the commands for error detection.",
    "- **Class 2** tags can be **written multiple times**.",
    "- **Class 3** tags can contain **embedded sensors** that can record environmental parameters, such as the current temperature or the tag\u2019s motion. These tags are **semi-passive**, because although they **have** an embedded power source, such as an integrated **battery**, they **can\u2019t initiate** wireless **communication** with other tags or readers.",
    "- **Class 4** tags can initiate communication with other tags of the same class, making them **active tags**.",
    "- **Class 5** tags can provide **power to other tags and communicate with all the previous tag** classes. Class 5 tags can act as **RFID readers**.",
    "### Information Stored in RFID Tags",
    "An RFID tag\u2019s memory usually stores four kinds of data: the **identification data**, which **identifies** the **entity** to which the tag is attached (this data includes user-defined fields, such as bank accounts); the **supplementary data**, which provides **further** **details** regarding the entity; the **control data**, used for the tag\u2019s internal **configuration**; and the tag\u2019s **manufacturer data**, which contains a tag\u2019s Unique Identifier (**UID**) and details regarding the tag\u2019s **production**, **type**, and **vendor**. You\u2019ll find the first two kinds of data in all the commercial tags; the last two can differ based on the tag\u2019s vendor."
