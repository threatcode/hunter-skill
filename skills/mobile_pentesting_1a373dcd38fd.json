    "Apache Cordova is recognized for enabling the development of **hybrid applications** using **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. It allows the creation of Android and iOS applications; however, it lacks a default mechanism for securing the application's source code. In contrast to React Native, Cordova does not compile the source code by default, which can lead to code tampering vulnerabilities. Cordova utilizes WebView to render applications, exposing the HTML and JavaScript code even after being compiled into APK or IPA files. React Native, conversely, employs a JavaScript VM to execute JavaScript code, offering better source code protection.",
    "### Cloning a Cordova Application",
    "Before cloning a Cordova application, ensure that NodeJS is installed along with other prerequisites like the Android SDK, Java JDK, and Gradle. The official Cordova [documentation](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/11.x/guide/cli/#install-pre-requisites-for-building) provides a comprehensive guide for these installations.",
    "Consider an example application named `Bank.apk` with the package name `com.android.bank`. To access the source code, unzip `bank.apk` and navigate to the `bank/assets/www` folder. This folder contains the complete source code of the application, including HTML and JS files. The application's configuration can be found in `bank/res/xml/config.xml`.",
    "To clone the application, follow these steps:",
    "```bash",
    "npm install -g cordova@latest",
    "cordova create bank-new com.android.bank Bank",
    "cd bank-new",
    "Copy the contents of `bank/assets/www` to `bank-new/www`, excluding `cordova_plugins.js`, `cordova.js`, `cordova-js-src/`, and the `plugins/` directory.",
    "Specify the platform (Android or iOS) when creating a new Cordova project. For cloning an Android app, add the Android platform. Note that Cordova's platform versions and Android API levels are distinct. Refer to the Cordova [documentation](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/11.x/guide/platforms/android/) for details on platform versions and supported Android APIs.",
    "To determine the appropriate Cordova Android platform version, check the `PLATFORM_VERSION_BUILD_LABEL` in the original application's `cordova.js` file."
