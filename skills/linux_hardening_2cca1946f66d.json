    "## Basic Information",
    "FreeIPA is an open-source **alternative** to Microsoft Windows **Active Directory**, mainly for **Unix** environments. It combines a complete **LDAP directory** with an MIT **Kerberos** Key Distribution Center for management akin to Active Directory. Utilizing the Dogtag **Certificate System** for CA & RA certificate management, it supports **multi-factor** authentication, including smartcards. SSSD is integrated for Unix authentication processes.",

    "### Files & Environment Variables",
    "- The file at `/etc/krb5.conf` is where Kerberos client information, necessary for enrollment in the domain, is stored. This includes KDCs and admin servers' locations, default settings, and mappings.",
    "- System-wide defaults for IPA clients and servers are set in the file located at `/etc/ipa/default.conf`.",
    "- Hosts within the domain must have a `krb5.keytab` file at `/etc/krb5.keytab` for authentication processes.",
    "- Various environment variables (`KRB5CCNAME`, `KRB5_KTNAME`, `KRB5_CONFIG`, `KRB5_KDC_PROFILE`, `KRB5RCACHETYPE`, `KRB5RCACHEDIR`, `KRB5_TRACE`, `KRB5_CLIENT_KTNAME`, `KPROP_PORT`) are used to point to specific files and settings relevant to Kerberos authentication.",
    "### Binaries",
    "Tools such as `ipa`, `kdestroy`, `kinit`, `klist`, `kpasswd`, `ksu`, `kswitch`, and `kvno` are key to managing FreeIPA domains, handling Kerberos tickets, changing passwords, and acquiring service tickets, among other functionalities.",
