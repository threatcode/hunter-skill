    "UUIDs are designed to be unique and **hard to guess**. They are structured in a specific format, divided into five groups represented as 32 hexadecimal digits. There are different versions of UUIDs, each serving different purposes:",
    "- **UUID v1** is time-based, incorporating the timestamp, clock sequence, and node ID (MAC address), but it can potentially expose system information.",
    "- **UUID v2** is similar to v1 but includes modifications for local domains (not widely used).",
    "- **UUID v3 and v5** generate UUIDs using hash values from namespace and name, with v3 using MD5 and v5 using SHA-1.",
    "- **UUID v4** is generated almost entirely randomly, providing a high level of anonymity but with a slight risk of duplicates.",

    "> Note that the version and subversion of the UUID usually appears in the same possition inside the UUID. For example in:\\",
