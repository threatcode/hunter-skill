    "**Linux Control Groups**, or **cgroups**, are a feature of the Linux kernel that allows the allocation, limitation, and prioritization of system resources like CPU, memory, and disk I/O among process groups. They offer a mechanism for **managing and isolating the resource usage** of process collections, beneficial for purposes such as resource limitation, workload isolation, and resource prioritization among different process groups.",
    "There are **two versions of cgroups**: version 1 and version 2. Both can be used concurrently on a system. The primary distinction is that **cgroups version 2** introduces a **hierarchical, tree-like structure**, enabling more nuanced and detailed resource distribution among process groups. Additionally, version 2 brings various enhancements, including:",
    "In addition to the new hierarchical organization, cgroups version 2 also introduced **several other changes and improvements**, such as support for **new resource controllers**, better support for legacy applications, and improved performance.",
    "Overall, cgroups **version 2 offers more features and better performance** than version 1, but the latter may still be used in certain scenarios where compatibility with older systems is a concern.",
    "You can list the v1 and v2 cgroups for any process by looking at its cgroup file in /proc/\\<pid>. You can start by looking at your shell\u2019s cgroups with this command:",
