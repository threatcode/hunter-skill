    "You can find more information about these processes [here (BF Forked & Threaded Stack Canaries)](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/stack-canaries/bf-forked-stack-canaries.md) and [here (BF Addresses in the Stack)](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/pie/bypassing-canary-and-pie.md).",
    "### **4. Find the stop gadget**",
    "This gadget basically allows to confirm that something interesting was executed by the ROP gadget because the execution didn't crash. Usually, this gadget is going to be something that **stops the execution** and it's positioned at the end of the ROP chain when looking for ROP gadgets to confirm a specific ROP gadget was executed",
