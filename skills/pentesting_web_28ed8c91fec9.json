    "To bypass 2FA, access the subsequent endpoint directly, knowing the path is crucial. If unsuccessful, alter the **Referrer header** to mimic navigation from the 2FA verification page.",
    "### **Token Reuse**",
    "Reutilizing previously used tokens for authentication within an account can be effective.",
    "### **Utilization of Unused Tokens**",
    "Extracting a token from one's own account to bypass 2FA in another account can be attempted.",
    "### **Exposure of Token**",
    "Investigate whether the token is disclosed in a response from the web application.",
    "### **Verification Link Exploitation**",
    "Using the **email verification link sent upon account creation** can allow profile access without 2FA, as highlighted in a detailed [post](https://srahulceh.medium.com/behind-the-scenes-of-a-security-bug-the-perils-of-2fa-cookie-generation-496d9519771b).",
    "### **Session Manipulation**",
    "Initiating sessions for both the user's and a victim's account, and completing 2FA for the user's account without proceeding, allows an attempt to access the next step in the victim's account flow, exploiting backend session management limitations."
