    "## Basic Information",
    "**Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI)** is a vulnerability that arises from the nature of the `script` tag in HTML. Unlike most resources, which are subject to the **Same-Origin Policy (SOP)**, scripts can be included from different domains. This behavior is intended to facilitate the use of libraries and other resources hosted on different servers but also introduces a potential security risk.",
    "### Key Characteristics of **XSSI**:",
    "- **Bypass of SOP**: Scripts are exempt from the **Same-Origin Policy**, allowing them to be included across domains.",
    "- **Data Exposure**: An attacker can exploit this behavior to read data loaded via the `script` tag.",
    "- **Impact on Dynamic JavaScript/JSONP**: **XSSI** is particularly relevant for dynamic JavaScript or **JSON with Padding (JSONP)**. These technologies often use \"ambient-authority\" information (like cookies) for authentication. When a script request is made to a different host, these credentials (e.g., cookies) are automatically included in the request.",
    "- **Authentication Token Leakage**: If an attacker can trick a user's browser into requesting a script from a server they control, they might be able to access sensitive information contained in these requests.",
    "### Types",
    "1. **Static JavaScript** - This represents the conventional form of XSSI.",
    "2. **Static JavaScript with Authentication** - This type is distinct because it requires authentication to access.",
    "3. **Dynamic JavaScript** - Involves JavaScript that dynamically generates content.",
    "4. **Non-JavaScript** - Refers to vulnerabilities that do not involve JavaScript directly.",
    "**The following information is a sumary of [https://www.scip.ch/en/?labs.20160414](https://www.scip.ch/en/?labs.20160414)**. Check it for further details."
