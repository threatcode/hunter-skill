  "description": "# Directory Traversal\n\n> Path Traversal, also known as Directory Traversal, is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker manipulates variables that reference files with \u201cdot-dot-slash (../)\u201d sequences or similar constructs. This can allow the attacker to access arbitrary files and directories stored on the file system.\n\n## Summary\n\n* [Tools](#tools)\n* [Methodology](#methodology)\n    * [URL Encoding](#url-encoding)\n    * [Double URL Encoding](#double-url-encoding)\n    * [Unico",
