    "Traditional coverage\u2013guided fuzzers (AFL++, libFuzzer, Honggfuzz\u2026) start with a small corpus of seeds and mutate bytes blindly.  When the target input format is complex (SQL, URLs, custom binary protocols) random mutations usually break the syntax before interesting branches are reached.",
