  "description": "# Zip Slip\n\n> The vulnerability is exploited using a specially crafted archive that holds directory traversal filenames (e.g. ../../shell.php). The Zip Slip vulnerability can affect numerous archive formats, including tar, jar, war, cpio, apk, rar and 7z. The attacker can then overwrite executable files and either invoke them remotely or wait for the system or user to call them, thus achieving remote command execution on the victim\u2019s machine.\n\n## Summary\n\n* [Tools](#tools)\n* [Methodology](#metho",
