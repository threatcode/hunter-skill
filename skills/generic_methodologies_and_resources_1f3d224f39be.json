    "The [Zip file format specification](https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT) provides comprehensive details on the structure and standards of zip files.",
    "It's crucial to note that password-protected zip files **do not encrypt filenames or file sizes** within, a security flaw not shared with RAR or 7z files which encrypt this information. Furthermore, zip files encrypted with the older ZipCrypto method are vulnerable to a **plaintext attack** if an unencrypted copy of a compressed file is available. This attack leverages the known content to crack the zip's password, a vulnerability detailed in [HackThis's article](https://www.hackthis.co.uk/articles/known-plaintext-attack-cracking-zip-files) and further explained in [this academic paper](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~mike/zipattacks.pdf). However, zip files secured with **AES-256** encryption are immune to this plaintext attack, showcasing the importance of choosing secure encryption methods for sensitive data.",

    "Modern Android malware droppers use malformed ZIP metadata to break static tools (jadx/apktool/unzip) while keeping the APK installable on-device. The most common tricks are:",
    "- Fake encryption by setting the ZIP General Purpose Bit Flag (GPBF) bit 0",
    "- Abusing large/custom Extra fields to confuse parsers",
    "- File/directory name collisions to hide real artifacts (e.g., a directory named `classes.dex/` next to the real `classes.dex`)"
