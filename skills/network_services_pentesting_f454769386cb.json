    "**Post Office Protocol (POP)** is described as a protocol within the realm of computer networking and the Internet, which is utilized for the extraction and **retrieval of email from a remote mail server**, making it accessible on the local device. Positioned within the application layer of the OSI model, this protocol enables users to fetch and receive email. The operation of **POP clients** typically involves establishing a connection to the mail server, downloading all messages, storing these messages locally on the client system, and subsequently removing them from the server. Although there are three iterations of this protocol, **POP3** stands out as the most prevalently employed version.",
