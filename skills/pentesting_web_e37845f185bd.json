    "### Comparison between SAML and OAuth",
    "- **SAML** is tailored towards providing enterprises with greater control over SSO login security.",
    "- **OAuth** is designed to be more mobile-friendly, uses JSON, and is a collaborative effort from companies like Google and Twitter.",

    "1. **Resource Access Attempt**: The user tries to access a protected resource.",
    "2. **SAML Request Generation**: The SP does not recognize the user and generates a SAML Request.",
    "3. **Redirect to IdP**: The user is redirected to the IdP, with the SAML Request passing through the user's browser.",
    "4. **IdP Receives Request**: The IdP receives the SAML Request."
