  "description": "# Insecure Deserialization\n\n> Serialization is the process of turning some object into a data format that can be restored later. People often serialize objects in order to save them to storage, or to send as part of communications. Deserialization is the reverse of that process -- taking data structured from some format, and rebuilding it into an object - OWASP\n\n## Summary\n\n* [Deserialization Identifier](#deserialization-identifier)\n* [POP Gadgets](#pop-gadgets)\n* [Labs](#labs)\n* [References](#r",
