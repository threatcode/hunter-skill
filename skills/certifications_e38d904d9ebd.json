    "**What is an IDS?**",
    "An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is designed to monitor network and system activities for malicious activities or policy violations. Its primary function is to detect potential security breaches, including unauthorized access and misuse, and to alert administrators.",
    "**Types of IDS:**",
    "1. **Network-Based IDS (NIDS):**",
    "- Monitors network traffic for signs of suspicious activity.",
    "- Placed at key points in the network to analyze traffic patterns.",
    "- Examples include Snort and Suricata.",
    "2. **Host-Based IDS (HIDS):**",
    "- Installed on individual hosts or devices to monitor system activities.",
    "- Detects malicious activities or policy violations on the host.",
    "- Examples include OSSEC and Tripwire.",
