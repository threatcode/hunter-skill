    "## Basic Information",
    "From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Streaming_Protocol):",
    "> The **Real Time Streaming Protocol** (**RTSP**) is a network control protocol designed for use in entertainment and communications systems to control streaming media servers. The protocol is used for establishing and controlling media sessions between end points. Clients of media servers issue VHS-style commands, such as play, record and pause, to facilitate real-time control of the media streaming from the server to a client (Video On Demand) or from a client to the server (Voice Recording).",
    "> The transmission of streaming data itself is not a task of RTSP. Most RTSP servers use the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) in conjunction with Real-time Control Protocol (RTCP) for media stream delivery. However, some vendors implement proprietary transport protocols. The RTSP server software from RealNetworks, for example, also used RealNetworks' proprietary Real Data Transport (RDT).",

    "**RTSP** is similar to HTTP but designed specifically for media streaming. It's defined in a straightforward specification which can be found here:",
    "[RTSP \u2013 RFC2326](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2326)",
    "Devices might allow **unauthenticated** or **authenticated** access. To check, a \"DESCRIBE\" request is sent. A basic example is shown below:",
    "`DESCRIBE rtsp://<ip>:<port> RTSP/1.0\\r\\nCSeq: 2`",
    "Remember, the correct formatting includes a double \"\\r\\n\" for a consistent response. A \"200 OK\" response indicates **unauthenticated access**, while \"401 Unauthorized\" signals the need for authentication, revealing if **Basic** or **Digest authentication** is required."
