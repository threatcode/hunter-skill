    "This is privilege that is held by any process allows the impersonation (but not creation) of any token, given that a handle to it can be obtained. A privileged token can be acquired from a Windows service (DCOM) by inducing it to perform NTLM authentication against an exploit, subsequently enabling the execution of a process with SYSTEM privileges. This vulnerability can be exploited using various tools, such as [juicy-potato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato), [RogueWinRM](https://github.com/antonioCoco/RogueWinRM) (which requires winrm to be disabled), [SweetPotato](https://github.com/CCob/SweetPotato), and [PrintSpoofer](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer).",
