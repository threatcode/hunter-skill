Common examples include URL encoding, Base64, HTML entity encoding, and Unicode transformations. Attackers use these methods as gadgets to bypass input filters, evade web application firewalls, or break out of sanitization routines.\n\n## Summary\n\n* [Unicode](#unicode)\n    * [Unicode Normalization](#unicode-normalization)\n    * [Punycod",
