    "### Core Principles",
    "1. **Never trust input** - All input is potentially malicious",
    "2. **Validate everything** - Check sizes, ranges, and formats",
    "3. **Fail safely** - Handle errors explicitly",
    "4. **Defense in depth** - Use multiple layers of protection",
    "5. **Least privilege** - Run with minimum necessary permissions",
