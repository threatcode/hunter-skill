Developers often rely on SCM systems like Git and Subversion (SVN) to manage their source code versions. However, poor security practices, such as leaving .git and .svn folders in production environments exposed to the internet, can pose significant risks.\n\n## Summary\n\n* [Methodology](#methodology)\n    * [Bazaar](./Bazaar.md)\n    * [Git](./Git.",
