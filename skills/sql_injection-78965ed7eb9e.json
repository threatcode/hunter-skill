    "## CQL Injection Limitations",
    "* Cassandra is a non-relational database, so CQL doesn't support `JOIN` or `UNION` statements, which makes cross-table queries more challenging.",
    "* Additionally, Cassandra lacks convenient built-in functions like `DATABASE()` or `USER()` for retrieving database metadata.",
    "* Another limitation is the absence of the `OR` operator in CQL, which prevents creating always-true conditions; for instance, a query like `SELECT * FROM table WHERE col1='a' OR col2='b';` will be rejected.",
    "* Time-based SQL injections, which typically rely on functions like `SLEEP()` to introduce a delay, are also difficult to execute in CQL since it doesn\u2019t include a `SLEEP()` function.",
    "* CQL does not allow subqueries or other nested statements, so a query like `SELECT * FROM table WHERE column=(SELECT column FROM table LIMIT 1);` would be rejected."
