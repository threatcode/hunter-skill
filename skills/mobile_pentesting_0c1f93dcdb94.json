    "## Installing the Burp Certificate on iOS Devices",
    "For secure web traffic analysis and SSL pinning on iOS devices, the Burp Suite can be utilized either through the **Burp Mobile Assistant** or via manual configuration. Below is a summarized guide on both methods:",
    "### Automated Installation with Burp Mobile Assistant",
    "The **Burp Mobile Assistant** simplifies the installation process of the Burp Certificate, proxy configuration, and SSL Pinning. Detailed guidance can be found on [PortSwigger's official documentation](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/mobile-assistant/installing).",
    "### Manual Installation Steps",
    "1. **Proxy Configuration:** Start by setting Burp as the proxy under the iPhone's Wi-Fi settings.",
    "2. **Certificate Download:** Navigate to `http://burp` on your device's browser to download the certificate.",
    "3. **Certificate Installation:** Install the downloaded profile via **Settings** > **General** > **VPN & Device Management**, then enable trust for the PortSwigger CA under **Certificate Trust Settings**.",
    "### Configuring an Interception Proxy",
    "The setup enables traffic analysis between the iOS device and the internet through Burp, requiring a Wi-Fi network that supports client-to-client traffic. If unavailable, a USB connection via usbmuxd can serve as an alternative. PortSwigger's tutorials provide in-depth instructions on [device configuration](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1841108-configuring-an-ios-device-to-work-with-burp) and [certificate installation](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1841109-installing-burp-s-ca-certificate-in-an-ios-device).",
    "### Advanced Configuration for Jailbroken Devices",
    "For users with jailbroken devices, SSH over USB (via **iproxy**) offers a method to route traffic directly through Burp:",
    "1.  **Establish SSH Connection:** Use iproxy to forward SSH to localhost, allowing connection from the iOS device to the computer running Burp."
