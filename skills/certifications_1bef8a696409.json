    "2. **Fragmentation**:",
    "- **Packet Fragmentation**: Breaking malicious payloads into smaller packets can evade detection by causing IDS to miss reassembled payloads. Techniques like IP fragmentation or TCP segmentation can be used.",
    "3. **Polymorphism and Metamorphism**:",
    "- **Polymorphic Code**: Altering the code structure without changing its functionality to evade signature-based detection. For example, changing variable names or code layout.",
    "- **Metamorphic Code**: Completely rewriting the code to avoid signature detection. This involves transforming the code into a different form while maintaining the same behavior.",
    "4. **Protocol Manipulation**:",
    "- **Protocol Tunneling**: Encapsulating malicious traffic within legitimate protocols. For instance, using HTTP or DNS tunneling to bypass IDS inspection.",
    "- **Protocol Abuses**: Exploiting protocol features to hide malicious payloads. For example, using malformed packets or unusual protocol behaviors.",
    "# Techniques for Evading Firewalls",
    "1. **Port Knocking**:",
    "- **Description**: A technique where an attacker sends a sequence of connection attempts to closed ports. If the correct sequence is detected, the firewall temporarily opens a port for the attacker."
