    "## Rules For Applying Zone-Based Policy Firewall",
    "- Router network interfaces\u2019 membership in zones is subject to several rules that govern interface behavior, as is the traffic moving between zone member interfaces:",
    "- A zone must be configured before interfaces can be assigned to the zone.",
    "- An interface can be assigned to only one security zone.",
    "- All traffic to and from a given interface is implicitly blocked when the interface is assigned to a zone, except traffic to and from other interfaces in the same zone, and traffic to any interface on the router.",
    "- Traffic is implicitly allowed to flow by default among interfaces that are members of the same zone.",
    "- In order to permit traffic to and from a zone member interface, a policy allowing or inspecting traffic must be configured between that zone and any other zone.",
    "- The self zone is the only exception to the default deny all policy. All traffic to any router interface is allowed until traffic is explicitly denied.",
    "- Traffic cannot flow between a zone member interface and any interface that is not a zone member. Pass, inspect, and drop actions can only be applied between two zones.",
    "- Interfaces that have not been assigned to a zone function as classical router ports and might still use classical stateful inspection/CBAC configuration."
