    "### Key Characteristics",
    "1. **Position-Independent** - Runs regardless of memory location",
    "2. **Self-Contained** - No external dependencies",
    "3. **Compact** - Small size to fit in limited buffers",
    "4. **Avoids Bad Characters** - Works around input restrictions (null bytes, etc.)",
    "## How Shellcode Works",
    "### The Execution Flow",
    "1. Vulnerability triggered (buffer overflow)",
    "2. Shellcode injected into memory",
    "3. Return address overwritten to point to shellcode",
    "4. Program returns/jumps to shellcode location",
    "5. Shellcode executes with program's privileges"
