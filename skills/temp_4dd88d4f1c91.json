    "When you run the code above, you will notice that `strcpy()` only copies the string \"Hello world\" to the buffer dest, even though the entire string contains more than that. This is because when making the copy, `strcpy()` stops when it sees number zero, which is represented by `'\\0'` in the code. It should be noted that this is not the same as character '0', which is represented as `0x30` in computers, not zero. Without the zero in the middle of the string, the string copy will end when it reaches the end of the string, which is marked by a zero (the zero is not shown in the code, but compilers will automatically add a zero to the end of a string).",
