It primarily handles the proxying of TCP connections and the forwarding of UDP packets (via the `UDP ASSOCIATE` command), operating at the session layer (Layer 5) of the OSI model. When tooling supports the `socks5h` scheme, DNS resolution is forced through the proxy, preventing local DNS leaks and making it harder to fingerprint the originating host.",
