    "SAP system consists of a number of fully integrated modules, which covers virtually every aspect of business management.",
    "Each SAP instance \\(or SID\\) is composed of three layers: database, application and presentation\\), each landscape usually consists of four instances: dev, test, QA and production.",
    "Each of the layers can be exploited to some extent, but most effect can be gained by **attacking the database**.",
    "Each SAP instance is divided into clients. Each one has a user SAP\\*, the application\u2019s equivalent of \u201croot\u201d.",
    "Upon initial creation, this user SAP\\* gets a default password: \u201c060719992\u201d \\(more default password below\\).",
    "You\u2019d be surprised if you knew how often these **passwords aren\u2019t changed in test or dev environments**!",
    "Try to get access to the shell of any server using username &lt;SID&gt;adm.",
    "Bruteforcing can help, whoever there can be Account Lockout mechanism.",
