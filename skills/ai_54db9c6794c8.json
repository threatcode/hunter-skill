    "1. **Data Collection**: Gathering data from various sources, such as databases, APIs, or files. The data can be structured (e.g., tables) or unstructured (e.g., text, images).",
    "2. **Data Cleaning**: Removing or correcting erroneous, incomplete, or irrelevant data points. This step may involve handling missing values, removing duplicates, and filtering outliers.",
    "3. **Data Transformation**: Converting the data into a suitable format for modeling. This may include normalization, scaling, encoding categorical variables, and creating new features through techniques like feature engineering.",
    "4. **Data Splitting**: Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to ensure the model can generalize well to unseen data.",
    "## Data Collection",
    "Data collection involves gathering data from various sources, which can include:",
    "- **Databases**: Extracting data from relational databases (e.g., SQL databases) or NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB).",
    "- **APIs**: Fetching data from web APIs, which can provide real-time or historical data.",
    "- **Files**: Reading data from files in formats like CSV, JSON, or XML.",
    "- **Web Scraping**: Collecting data from websites using web scraping techniques.",
    "Depending on the goal of the machine learning project, the data will be extracted and collected from relevant sources to ensure it is representative of the problem domain.",
