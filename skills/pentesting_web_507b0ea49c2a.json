    "## What is a DApp?",
    "A DApp is a decentralized application that runs on a peer-to-peer network, rather than being hosted on a centralized server. DApps are typically built on **blockchain technology**, which should allow for transparency, security, and immutability of data.",
    "## Web3 DApp Architecture",
    "According to [**this post**](https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/web2-meets-web3-hacking-decentralized-applications) there are 3 different types of Web3 DApps architecture:",
    "### \"API-less\" DApps",
    "These DApps are built on top of a blockchain and do not rely on any centralized APIs or backend. You could think that the blockchain is the actual backedn of the application. They are **fully decentralized** and can be accessed directly through the blockchain.",
    "In order to interact with the blockchain the client will usually use a **wallet**. The wallet will sign the transactions and send them to the blockchain. The client might also use a **node** to read data from the blockchain.",
    "### \"API-Enabled\" DApps",
    "These DApps are built on top of a blockchain but also rely on centralized APIs usually to gather information. They are **mostly decentralized** because even if they rely on a centralized API, the core functionality of the DApp is still on the blockchain. The communication of the client with the blockchain is usually done through a **wallet**.",
    "A good example of this type of DApp is a **NFT minting application**. The server allows to uplaod the images but the minting us done by the client through a wallet.",
    "### \"Full-Scale\" DApps",
    "These DApps are built on top of a blockchain but also rely on centralized APIs and backend servers. They **could be partially decentralized** as the client might be able to perform operations on the blockchain using a wallet. However, usually the **backend will also be able to perform operations on the blockchain**.",
    "A good example for this type of DApp is a cross-chain bridge where an offchain component is needed to **communicate with both smart contracts in different blockchains** to perform the transfer of assets."
