    "### Docker Basics",
    "#### What is",
    "Docker is the **forefront platform** in the **containerization industry**, spearheading **continuous innovation**. It facilitates the effortless creation and distribution of applications, spanning from **traditional to futuristic**, and assures their **secure deployment** across diverse environments.",
    "#### Basic docker architecture",
    "- [**containerd**](http://containerd.io): This is a **core runtime** for containers, tasked with the comprehensive **management of a container's lifecycle**. This involves handling **image transfer and storage**, in addition to overseeing the **execution, monitoring, and networking** of containers. **More detailed insights** on containerd are **further explored**.",
    "- The **container-shim** plays a critical role as an **intermediary** in the handling of **headless containers**, seamlessly taking over from **runc** after the containers are initialized.",
    "- [**runc**](http://runc.io): Esteemed for its **lightweight and universal container runtime** capabilities, runc is aligned with the **OCI standard**. It is used by containerd to **start and manage containers** according to the **OCI guidelines**, having evolved from the original **libcontainer**.",
    "- [**grpc**](http://www.grpc.io) is essential for **facilitating communication** between containerd and the **docker-engine**, ensuring **efficient interaction**.",
    "- The [**OCI**](https://www.opencontainers.org) is pivotal in maintaining the **OCI specifications** for runtime and images, with the latest Docker versions being **compliant with both the OCI image and runtime** standards.",
    "#### Basic commands",
    "```bash",
    "docker version #Get version of docker client, API, engine, containerd, runc, docker-init",
    "docker info #Get more infomarion about docker settings"
