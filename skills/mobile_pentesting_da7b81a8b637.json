    "## **Basic Information**",
    "Xamarin is an **open-source platform** designed for developers to **build apps for iOS, Android, and Windows** using the .NET and C# frameworks. This platform offers access to numerous tools and extensions to create modern applications efficiently.",
    "### Xamarin's Architecture",
    "- For **Android**, Xamarin integrates with Android and Java namespaces through .NET bindings, operating within the Mono execution environment alongside the Android Runtime (ART). Managed Callable Wrappers (MCW) and Android Callable Wrappers (ACW) facilitate communication between Mono and ART, both of which are built on the Linux kernel.",
    "- For **iOS**, applications run under the Mono runtime, utilizing full Ahead of Time (AOT) compilation to convert C# .NET code into ARM assembly language. This process runs alongside the Objective-C Runtime on a UNIX-like kernel.",
    "### .NET Runtime and Mono Framework",
    "The **.NET framework** includes assemblies, classes, and namespaces for application development, with the .NET Runtime managing code execution. It offers platform independence and backward compatibility. The **Mono Framework** is an open-source version of the .NET framework, initiated in 2005 to extend .NET to Linux, now supported by Microsoft and led by Xamarin.",
    "### Reverse Engineering Xamarin Apps",
    "#### Decompilation of Xamarin Assemblies",
    "Decompilation transforms compiled code back into source code. In Windows, the Modules window in Visual Studio can identify modules for decompilation, allowing for direct access to third-party code and extraction of source code for analysis.",
    "#### JIT vs AOT Compilation",
    "- **Android** supports Just-In-Time (JIT) and Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation, with a Hybrid AOT mode for optimal execution speed. Full AOT is exclusive to Enterprise licenses.",
    "- **iOS** solely employs AOT compilation due to Apple's restrictions on dynamic code execution."
