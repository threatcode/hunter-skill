    "## Introduction",
    "Available since the Bluetooth 4.0 specification, BLE uses only 40 channels, covering the range of 2400 to 2483.5 MHz. In contrast, traditional Bluetooth uses 79 channels in that same range.",
    "BLE devices communicate is by sending **advertising packets** (**beacons**), these packets broadcast the BLE device\u2019s existence to other nearby devices. These beacons sometimes **send data**, too.",
    "The listening device, also called a central device, can respond to an advertising packet with a **SCAN request** sent specifically to the advertising device. The **response** to that scan uses the same structure as the **advertising** packet with additional information that couldn\u2019t fit on the initial advertising request, such as the full device name.",
    "![](<../../images/image (152).png>)",
    "The preamble byte synchronizes the frequency, whereas the four-byte access address is a **connection identifier**, which is used in scenarios where multiple devices are trying to establish connections on the same channels. Next, the Protocol Data Unit (**PDU**) contains the **advertising data**. There are several types of PDU; the most commonly used are ADV_NONCONN_IND and ADV_IND. Devices use the **ADV_NONCONN_IND** PDU type if they **don\u2019t accept connections**, transmitting data only in the advertising packet. Devices use **ADV_IND** if they **allow connections** and **stop sending advertising** packets once a **connection** has been **established**.",
    "### GATT",
    "The **Generic Attribute Profile** (GATT) defines how the **device should format and transfer data**. When you\u2019re analyzing a BLE device\u2019s attack surface, you\u2019ll often concentrate your attention on the GATT (or GATTs), because it\u2019s how **device functionality gets triggered** and how data gets stored, grouped, and modified. The GATT lists a device\u2019s characteristics, descriptors, and services in a table as either 16- or 32-bits values. A **characteristic** is a **data** value **sent** between the central device and peripheral. These characteristics can have **descriptors** that **provide additional information about them**. **Characteristics** are often **grouped** in **services** if they\u2019re related to performing a particular action.",
