    "## Basic information",
    "IBM MQ is an IBM technology to manage message queues. As other **message broker** technologies, it is dedicated to receive, store, process and classify information between producers and consumers.",
    "By default, **it exposes IBM MQ TCP port 1414**.",
    "Sometimes, HTTP REST API can be exposed on port **9443**.",
    "Metrics (Prometheus) could also be accessed from TCP port **9157**.",
    "The IBM MQ TCP port 1414 can be used to manipulate messages, queues, channels, ... but **also to control the instance**.",
    "IBM provides a large technical documentation available on [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-mq](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-mq).",
    "## Tools",
    "A suggested tool for easy exploitation is **[punch-q](https://github.com/sensepost/punch-q)**, with Docker usage. The tool is actively using the Python library `pymqi`.",
    "For a more manual approach, use the Python library **[pymqi](https://github.com/dsuch/pymqi)**. [IBM MQ dependencies](https://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm%7EWebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/WebSphere+MQ&release=9.0.0.4&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=9.0.0.4-IBM-MQC-*,9.0.0.4-IBM-MQ-Install-Java-All,9.0.0.4-IBM-MQ-Java-InstallRA&useReleaseAsTarget=true&includeSupersedes=0&source=fc) are needed.",
    "### Installing pymqi",
    "**IBM MQ dependencies** needs to be installed and loaded:",
    "1. Create an account (IBMid) on [https://login.ibm.com/](https://login.ibm.com/)."
