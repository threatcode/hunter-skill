    "As observed on September 16, Linux servers deployed in Azure with the mentioned services are susceptible due to a vulnerable version of OMI. This vulnerability lies in the OMI server's handling of messages through the `/wsman` endpoint without requiring an Authentication header, incorrectly authorizing the client.",
    "An attacker can exploit this by sending an \"ExecuteShellCommand\" SOAP payload without an Authentication header, compelling the server to execute commands with root privileges."
