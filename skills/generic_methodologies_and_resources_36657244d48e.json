    "Key points to note:",
    "- **Domain Name Relinquishment**: A host can release its domain name by sending a packet with a TTL of zero.",
    "- **Usage Restriction**: mDNS typically resolves names ending in **.local** only. Conflicts with non-mDNS hosts in this domain require network configuration adjustments.",
    "- **Networking Details**:",
    "- Ethernet multicast MAC addresses: IPv4 - `01:00:5E:00:00:FB`, IPv6 - `33:33:00:00:00:FB`.",
    "- IP addresses: IPv4 - `224.0.0.251`, IPv6 - `ff02::fb`.",
    "- Operates over UDP port 5353.",
    "- mDNS queries are confined to the local network and do not cross routers.",
    "## DNS-SD (Service Discovery)",
    "DNS-SD is a protocol for discovering services on a network by querying specific domain names (e.g., `_printers._tcp.local`). A response includes all related domains, such as available printers in this case. A comprehensive list of service types can be found [here](http://www.dns-sd.org/ServiceTypes.html).",
