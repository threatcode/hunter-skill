    "### Prepopulate forms trick",
    "Sometimes is possible to **fill the value of fields of a form using GET parameters when loading a page**. An attacker may abuse this behaviour to fill a form with arbitrary data and send the clickjacking payload so the user press the button Submit.",
    "### Populate form with Drag\\&Drop",
    "If you need the user to **fill a form** but you don't want to directly ask him to write some specific information (like the email and or specific password that you know), you can just ask him to **Drag\\&Drop** something that will write your controlled data like in [**this example**](https://lutfumertceylan.com.tr/posts/clickjacking-acc-takeover-drag-drop/).",
