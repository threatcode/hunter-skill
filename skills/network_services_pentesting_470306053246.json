    "### What is an Elasticsearch index?",
    "An Elasticsearch **index** is a collection of **related documents** stored as **JSON**. Each document consists of **keys** and their corresponding **values** (strings, numbers, booleans, dates, arrays, geolocations, etc.).",
    "Elasticsearch uses an efficient data structure called an **inverted index** to facilitate fast full-text searches. This index lists every unique word in the documents and identifies the documents in which each word appears.",
    "During the indexing process, Elasticsearch stores the documents and constructs the inverted index, allowing for near real-time searching. The **index API** is used to add or update JSON documents within a specific index.",
    "**Default port**: 9200/tcp",

    "The protocol used to access Elasticsearch is **HTTP**. When you access it via HTTP you will find some interesting information: `http://10.10.10.115:9200/`",
