LaTeX is widely used for document preparation and typesetting, particularly in academia, for producing high-quality scientific and mathematical documents. Due to its powerful scripting capabilities, LaTeX can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary commands if proper safeguards are not in place.\n\n## Summary\n\n* [File Manipulation](#file-manipulation)\n    * [Read File",
