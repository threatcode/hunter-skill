    "- **Vulnerable Web**: The target website from which information is intended to be extracted.",
    "- **Attacker's Web**: The malicious website created by the attacker, which the victim visits, hosting the exploit.",
    "- **Inclusion Method**: The technique employed to incorporate the Vulnerable Web into the Attacker's Web (e.g., window.open, iframe, fetch, HTML tag with href, etc.).",
