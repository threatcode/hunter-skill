    "### **GOT: Global Offset Table**",
    "The **Global Offset Table (GOT)** is a mechanism used in dynamically linked binaries to manage the **addresses of external functions**. Since these **addresses are not known until runtime** (due to dynamic linking), the GOT provides a way to **dynamically update the addresses of these external symbols** once they are resolved.",
    "Each entry in the GOT corresponds to a symbol in the external libraries that the binary may call. When a **function is first called, its actual address is resolved by the dynamic linker and stored in the GOT**. Subsequent calls to the same function use the address stored in the GOT, thus avoiding the overhead of resolving the address again.",
    "### **PLT: Procedure Linkage Table**",
    "The **Procedure Linkage Table (PLT)** works closely with the GOT and serves as a trampoline to handle calls to external functions. When a binary **calls an external function for the first time, control is passed to an entry in the PLT associated with that function**. This PLT entry is responsible for invoking the dynamic linker to resolve the function's address if it has not already been resolved. After the address is resolved, it is stored in the **GOT**.",
    "**Therefore,** GOT entries are used directly once the address of an external function or variable is resolved. **PLT entries are used to facilitate the initial resolution** of these addresses via the dynamic linker.",
