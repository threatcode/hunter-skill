    "> Reinventing the wheel isn't ideal because SQLmap has been rigorously developed, tested, and improved by experts. Using a reliable, community-supported tool means you benefit from established best practices and avoid the high risk of missing vulnerabilities or introducing errors in custom code.",
    "> However you should always know how SQLmap is working, and be able to replicate it manually if necessary.",
