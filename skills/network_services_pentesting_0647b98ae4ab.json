Developed by the **Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)**, SIP is defined in **RFC 3261** and has become the de facto standard for VoIP and unified communications.",

    "## Basic Information",
    "SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) is a **signaling and call control protocol** widely used for establishing, modifying, and terminating multimedia sessions, including voice, video, and instant messaging, over IP networks. Developed by the **Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)**, SIP is defined in **RFC 3261** and has become the de facto standard for VoIP and unified communications.",
    "Some key features of SIP include:",
    "1. **Text-based Protocol**: SIP is a text-based protocol, which makes it human-readable and easier to debug. It is based on a request-response model, similar to HTTP, and uses methods like INVITE, ACK, BYE, and CANCEL for controlling call sessions.",
    "2. **Scalability and Flexibility**: SIP is highly scalable and can be used in small-scale deployments as well as large enterprise and carrier-grade environments. It can be easily extended with new features, making it adaptable to various use cases and requirements.",
    "3. **Interoperability**: SIP's widespread adoption and standardization ensure better interoperability between different devices, applications, and service providers, promoting seamless communication across various platforms.",
    "4. **Modular Design**: SIP works with other protocols like **RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol)** for media transmission and **SDP (Session Description Protocol)** for describing multimedia sessions. This modular design allows for greater flexibility and compatibility with different media types and codecs.",
    "5. **Proxy and Redirect Servers**: SIP can use proxy and redirect servers to facilitate call routing and provide advanced features like call forwarding, call transfer, and voicemail services.",
    "6. **Presence and Instant Messaging**: SIP is not limited to voice and video communication. It also supports presence and instant messaging, enabling a wide range of unified communication applications.",
    "Despite its many advantages, SIP can be complex to configure and manage, particularly when dealing with NAT traversal and firewall issues. However, its versatility, scalability, and extensive support across the industry make it a popular choice for VoIP and multimedia communication.",
    "### SIP Methods",
    "The core SIP methods defined in **RFC 3261** include:",
    "1. **INVITE**: Used to **initiate a new session (call)** or modify an existing one. The INVITE method carries the session description (typically using SDP) to inform the recipient about the details of the proposed session, such as media types, codecs, and transport protocols."
