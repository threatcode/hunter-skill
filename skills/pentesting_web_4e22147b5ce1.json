    "OAuth offers various versions, with foundational insights accessible at [OAuth 2.0 documentation](https://oauth.net/2/). This discussion primarily centers on the widely used [OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant type](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/), providing an **authorization framework that enables an application to access or perform actions on a user's account in another application** (the authorization server).",
    "Consider a hypothetical website _**https://example.com**_, designed to **showcase all your social media posts**, including private ones. To achieve this, OAuth 2.0 is employed. _https://example.com_ will request your permission to **access your social media posts**. Consequently, a consent screen will appear on _https://socialmedia.com_, outlining the **permissions being requested and the developer making the request**. Upon your authorization, _https://example.com_ gains the ability to **access your posts on your behalf**.",
    "It's essential to grasp the following components within the OAuth 2.0 framework:",
    "- **resource owner**: You, as the **user/entity**, authorize access to your resource, like your social media account posts.",
    "- **resource server**: The **server managing authenticated requests** after the application has secured an `access token` on behalf of the `resource owner`, e.g., **https://socialmedia.com**.",
    "- **client application**: The **application seeking authorization** from the `resource owner`, such as **https://example.com**.",
    "- **authorization server**: The **server that issues `access tokens`** to the `client application` following the successful authentication of the `resource owner` and securing authorization, e.g., **https://socialmedia.com**.",
    "- **client_id**: A public, unique identifier for the application.",
    "- **client_secret:** A confidential key, known solely to the application and the authorization server, used for generating `access_tokens`.",
    "- **response_type**: A value specifying **the type of token requested**, like `code`.",
    "- **scope**: The **level of access** the `client application` is requesting from the `resource owner`.",
    "- **redirect_uri**: The **URL to which the user is redirected after authorization**. This typically must align with the pre-registered redirect URL."
