    "#### Techniques for Evasion",
    "1. **TTL Manipulation**:",
    "- Sending packets with a Time-To-Live (TTL) value that allows them to reach the IDS/IPS but not the final destination can trick the system into ignoring subsequent packets with the same sequence but malicious content.",
    "- **Nmap Option**: `--ttl <value>` [1].",
    "2. **Avoiding Signatures**:",
    "- Adding garbage data to packets to avoid matching IDS/IPS signatures.",
    "- **Nmap Option**: `--data-length 25` [1].",
    "3. **Fragmented Packets**:",
    "- Fragmenting packets so that if the IDS/IPS cannot reassemble them, they will pass through undetected.",
    "- **Nmap Option**: `-f` [1][4].",
    "4. **Invalid Checksum**:",
    "- Sending packets with invalid checksums, which are often ignored by sensors for performance reasons but rejected by the final host.",
    "- Example: A packet with the RST flag and an invalid checksum [1]."
