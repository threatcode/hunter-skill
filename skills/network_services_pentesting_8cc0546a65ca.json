It acts as a critical component in **Unix-based systems**, facilitating the exchange of information between these systems. The **port** associated with **Portmapper** is frequently scanned by attackers as it can reveal valuable information. This information includes the type of **Unix Operating System (OS)** running and details about the services that are available on the system. Additionally, **Portmapper** is commonly used in conjunction with **NFS (Network File System)**, **NIS (Network Information Service)**, and other **RPC-based services** to manage network services effectively.",
