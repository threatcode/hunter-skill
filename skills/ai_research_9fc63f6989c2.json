    "# Server-Side Request Forgery Prevention Cheat Sheet",
    "## Introduction",
    "The objective of the cheat sheet is to provide advice regarding the protection against Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.",
    "This cheat sheet will focus on the defensive point of view and will not explain how to perform this attack. [This talk](https://www.slideshare.net/OrangeTsai/ssrf-attacks) by security researcher Orange Tsai, as well as [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V96Uw1VeHGRirvNw9QfZJTrzwLf28yJOl6PMD0SxHRg), provide techniques on how to perform this kind of attack.",
    "## Context",
    "SSRF is an attack vector that abuses an application to interact with the internal/external network or the machine itself. One of the enablers for this vector is the mishandling of URLs, as showcased in the following examples:",
    "- Image on an external server (e.g., user enters image URL of their avatar for the application to download and use).",
    "- Custom WebHook (users have to specify Webhook handlers or Callback URLs).",
    "- Internal requests to interact with another service to serve a specific functionality. Most of the time, user data is sent along to be processed, and if poorly handled, can perform specific injection attacks.",
    "## Overview of a SSRF Common Flow",
    "SSRF Common Flow",
    "**Notes:**",
    "- SSRF is not limited to the HTTP protocol. Generally, the first request is HTTP, but in cases where the application itself performs the second request, it could use different protocols (e.g., FTP, SMB, SMTP, etc.) and schemes (e.g., `file://`, `phar://`, `gopher://`, `data://`, `dict://`, etc.).",
    "- If the application is vulnerable to XML eXternal Entity (XXE) injection, it can be exploited to perform an SSRF attack. Take a look at the [XXE cheat sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html) to learn how to prevent exposure to XXE.",
