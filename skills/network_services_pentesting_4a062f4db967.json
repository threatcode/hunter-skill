    "### **Understanding API Types**",
    "- **SOAP/XML Web Services**: Utilize the WSDL format for documentation, typically found at `?wsdl` paths. Tools like **SOAPUI** and **WSDLer** (Burp Suite Extension) are instrumental for parsing and generating requests. Example documentation is accessible at [DNE Online](http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx).",
    "- **REST APIs (JSON)**: Documentation often comes in WADL files, yet tools like [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) provide a more user-friendly interface for interaction. **Postman** is a valuable tool for creating and managing example requests.",
    "- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs offering a complete and understandable description of the data in your API.",
    "### **Practice Labs**",
    "- [**VAmPI**](https://github.com/erev0s/VAmPI): A deliberately vulnerable API for hands-on practice, covering the OWASP top 10 API vulnerabilities.",
    "### **Effective Tricks for API Pentesting**",
    "- **SOAP/XML Vulnerabilities**: Explore XXE vulnerabilities, although DTD declarations are often restricted. CDATA tags may allow payload insertion if the XML remains valid.",
    "- **Privilege Escalation**: Test endpoints with varying privilege levels to identify unauthorized access possibilities.",
    "- **CORS Misconfigurations**: Investigate CORS settings for potential exploitability through CSRF attacks from authenticated sessions.",
    "- **Endpoint Discovery**: Leverage API patterns to discover hidden endpoints. Tools like fuzzers can automate this process."
