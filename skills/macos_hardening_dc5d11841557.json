    "### **Registers**",
    "x64 expands upon the x86 architecture, featuring **16 general-purpose registers** labeled `rax`, `rbx`, `rcx`, `rdx`, `rbp`, `rsp`, `rsi`, `rdi`, and `r8` through `r15`. Each of these can store a **64-bit** (8-byte) value. These registers also have 32-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit sub-registers for compatibility and specific tasks.",
    "1. **`rax`** - Traditionally used for **return values** from functions.",
    "2. **`rbx`** - Often used as a **base register** for memory operations.",
    "3. **`rcx`** - Commonly used for **loop counters**.",
    "4. **`rdx`** - Used in various roles including extended arithmetic operations.",
    "5. **`rbp`** - **Base pointer** for the stack frame.",
    "6. **`rsp`** - **Stack pointer**, keeping track of the top of the stack.",
    "7. **`rsi`** and **`rdi`** - Used for **source** and **destination** indexes in string/memory operations.",
    "8. **`r8`** to **`r15`** - Additional general-purpose registers introduced in x64.",
