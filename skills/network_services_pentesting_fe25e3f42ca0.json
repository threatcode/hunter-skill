    "## What is Angular",
    "Angular is a **powerful** and **open-source** front-end framework maintained by **Google**. It uses **TypeScript** to enhance code readability and debugging. With strong security mechanisms, Angular prevents common client-side vulnerabilities like **XSS** and **open redirects**. It can be used on the **server-side** too, making security considerations important from **both angles**.",
    "## Framework architecture",
    "In order to better understand the Angular basics, let\u2019s go through its essential concepts."
