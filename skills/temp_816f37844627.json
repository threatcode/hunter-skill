    "# Building a Honeynet in the Cloud: A Step-by-Step Guide",
    "## Introduction",
    "A honeynet is a network of virtual machines that simulates a network environment to attract and trap attackers. These honeynets are designed to be vulnerable to various types of attacks, providing cybersecurity professionals with valuable insights into attack vectors, techniques, and behaviors. Cloud platforms offer a scalable and cost-effective way to deploy honeynets. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a honeynet in the cloud.",
    "## Prerequisites",
    "- Cloud provider account (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)",
    "- Basic understanding of cloud services and networking",
    "- Familiarity with virtual machines and containers",
    "## Step 1: Planning the Honeynet Architecture",
    "Before deploying the honeynet, plan out its architecture. Decide on the number of honeypots you want to deploy, the services they will run, and how they will be networked together. Also, consider implementing a logging and monitoring system to capture data for analysis.",
    "## Step 2: Setting Up the Virtual Network",
    "Create a virtual network in your cloud provider's console. This network will host all your honeypots. Make sure to isolate this network from your production environment to prevent any potential risks.",
    "### Example: AWS VPC Setup",
    "1. Go to the AWS Management Console.",
    "2. Navigate to \"VPC\" and create a new VPC.",
    "3. Configure the IP range and other settings."
