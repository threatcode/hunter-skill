    "## Introduction",
    "Universal links offer a **seamless redirection** experience to users by directly opening content in the app, bypassing the need for Safari redirection. These links are **unique** and secure, as they cannot be claimed by other apps. This is ensured by hosting a `apple-app-site-association` JSON file on the website's root directory, establishing a verifiable link between the website and the app. In cases where the app is not installed, Safari will take over and direct the user to the webpage, maintaining the app's presence.",
    "For penetration testers, the `apple-app-site-association` file is of particular interest as it may reveal **sensitive paths**, potentially including ones related to unreleased features.",
    "### **Analyzing the Associated Domains Entitlement**",
    "Developers enable Universal Links by configuring the **Associated Domains** in Xcode's Capabilities tab or by inspecting the `.entitlements` file. Each domain is prefixed with `applinks:`. For example, Telegram's configuration might appear as follows:",
    "```xml",
    "<key>com.apple.developer.associated-domains</key>",
    "<array>",
    "<string>applinks:telegram.me</string>",
    "<string>applinks:t.me</string>",
    "</array>",
    "For more comprehensive insights, refer to the [archived Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/AppSearch/UniversalLinks.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016308-CH12-SW2).",
    "If working with a compiled application, entitlements can be extracted as outlined in [this guide](extracting-entitlements-from-compiled-application.md)."
