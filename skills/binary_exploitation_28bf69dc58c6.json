    "For example, an **8-bit unsigned integer** can represent values from **0 to 255**. If you attempt to store the value 256 in an 8-bit unsigned integer, it wraps around to 0 due to the limitation of its storage capacity. Similarly, for a **16-bit unsigned integer**, which can hold values from **0 to 65,535**, adding 1 to 65,535 will wrap the value back to 0.",
    "Moreover, an **8-bit signed integer** can represent values from **-128 to 127**. This is because one bit is used to represent the sign (positive or negative), leaving 7 bits to represent the magnitude. The most negative number is represented as **-128** (binary `10000000`), and the most positive number is **127** (binary `01111111`).",
