    "Welcome to HackTricks' comprehensive guide on Threat Modeling! Embark on an exploration of this critical aspect of cybersecurity, where we identify, understand, and strategize against potential vulnerabilities in a system. This thread serves as a step-by-step guide packed with real-world examples, helpful software, and easy-to-understand explanations. Ideal for both novices and experienced practitioners looking to fortify their cybersecurity defenses.",
    "### Commonly Used Scenarios",
    "1. **Software Development**: As part of the Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC), threat modeling helps in **identifying potential sources of vulnerabilities** in the early stages of development.",
    "2. **Penetration Testing**: The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) framework requires **threat modeling to understand the system's vulnerabilities** before carrying out the test.",
    "### Threat Model in a Nutshell",
    "A Threat Model is typically represented as a diagram, image, or some other form of visual illustration that depicts the planned architecture or existing build of an application. It bears resemblance to a **data flow diagram**, but the key distinction lies in its security-oriented design.",
    "Threat models often feature elements marked in red, symbolizing potential vulnerabilities, risks, or barriers. To streamline the process of risk identification, the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) triad is employed, forming the basis of many threat modeling methodologies, with STRIDE being one of the most common. However, the chosen methodology can vary depending on the specific context and requirements.",
    "### The CIA Triad",
    "The CIA Triad is a widely recognized model in the field of information security, standing for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. These three pillars form the foundation upon which many security measures and policies are built, including threat modeling methodologies.",
    "1. **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that the data or system is not accessed by unauthorized individuals. This is a central aspect of security, requiring appropriate access controls, encryption, and other measures to prevent data breaches.",
    "2. **Integrity**: The accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of the data over its lifecycle. This principle ensures that the data is not altered or tampered with by unauthorized parties. It often involves checksums, hashing, and other data verification methods.",
    "3. **Availability**: This ensures that data and services are accessible to authorized users when needed. This often involves redundancy, fault tolerance, and high-availability configurations to keep systems running even in the face of disruptions."
