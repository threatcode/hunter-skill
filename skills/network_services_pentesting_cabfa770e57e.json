    "### Summary & Security Tips",
    "- **Purpose**: Syncs device clocks over networks.",
    "- **Importance**: Critical for security, logging, crypto-protocols and distributed systems.",
    "- **Security Measures**:",
    "- Use trusted NTP or NTS (Network Time Security) sources with authentication.",
    "- Restrict who can query/command the daemon (``restrict default noquery``, ``kod`` etc.).",
    "- Disable legacy Mode-6/7 control queries (``monlist``, ``ntpdc``) or rate-limit them.",
    "- Monitor synchronization drift/leap-second state for tampering.",
    "- Keep the daemon updated (see recent CVEs below).",
