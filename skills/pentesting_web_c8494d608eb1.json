    "SSI (Server Side Includes) are directives that are **placed in HTML pages, and evaluated on the server** while the pages are being served. They let you **add dynamically generated content** to an existing HTML page, without having to serve the entire page via a CGI program, or other dynamic technology.\\",
    "For example, you might place a directive into an existing HTML page, such as:",
    "`<!--#echo var=\"DATE_LOCAL\" -->`",
    "And, when the page is served, this fragment will be evaluated and replaced with its value:",
    "`Tuesday, 15-Jan-2013 19:28:54 EST`",
    "The decision of when to use SSI, and when to have your page entirely generated by some program, is usually a matter of how much of the page is static, and how much needs to be recalculated every time the page is served. SSI is a great way to add small pieces of information, such as the current time - shown above. But if a majority of your page is being generated at the time that it is served, you need to look for some other solution.",
    "You can infer the presence of SSI if the web application uses files with the extensions**`.shtml`, `.shtm` or `.stm`**, but it's not only the case.",
    "A typical SSI expression has the following format:",
    "<!--#directive param=\"value\" -->",
