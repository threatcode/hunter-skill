    "RSQL is a query language designed for parameterized filtering of inputs in RESTful APIs.

    "## Overview",
    "RSQL Injection is a vulnerability in web applications that use RSQL as a query language in RESTful APIs. Similar to [SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection) and [LDAP Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/LDAP_Injection), this vulnerability occurs when RSQL filters are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious queries to access, modify or delete data without authorization.",
    "## How does it work?",
    "RSQL allows you to build advanced queries in RESTful APIs, for example:",
    "```bash",
    "/products?filter=price>100;category==electronics",
    "This translates to a structured query that filters products with price greater than 100 and category \u201celectronics\u201d.",
    "If the application does not correctly validate user input, an attacker could manipulate the filter to execute unexpected queries, such as:",
    "```bash",
    "/products?filter=id=in=(1,2,3);delete_all==true",
    "Or even take advantage to extract sensitive information with Boolean queries or nested subqueries."
