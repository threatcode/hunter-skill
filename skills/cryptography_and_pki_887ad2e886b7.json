    "**Instructions:**",
    "1. Analyze the frequency of letters in the encrypted message.",
    "2. Compare it with the typical frequency of English letters.",
    "3. Substitute the letters to reveal the original text.",
    "**Answer:**",
    "Assuming the most frequent letter in the cipher text corresponds to the letter 'E' and mapping other characters by their frequency, you might decipher the message as:",
