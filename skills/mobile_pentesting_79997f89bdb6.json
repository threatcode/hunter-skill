    "- **UIWebView**, which is no longer recommended from iOS 12 onwards due to its lack of support for disabling **JavaScript**, making it susceptible to script injection and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks.",
    "- **WKWebView** is the preferred option for incorporating web content into apps, offering enhanced control over the content and security features. **JavaScript** is enabled by default, but it can be disabled if necessary. It also supports features to prevent JavaScript from automatically opening windows and ensures that all content is loaded securely. Additionally, **WKWebView**'s architecture minimizes the risk of memory corruption affecting the main app process.",
    "- **SFSafariViewController** offers a standardized web browsing experience within apps, recognizable by its specific layout including a read-only address field, share and navigation buttons, and a direct link to open content in Safari. Unlike **WKWebView**, **JavaScript** cannot be disabled in **SFSafariViewController**, which also shares cookies and data with Safari, maintaining user privacy from the app. It must be displayed prominently according to App Store guidelines.",
