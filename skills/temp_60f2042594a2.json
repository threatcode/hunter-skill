    "One of the simplest ways to analyze logs is by performing plain text searches using grep. grep is a command line tool that can search for matching text in a file, or in output from other commands.

    "To perform a simple search, enter your search string followed by the file you want to search. Here, we search the authentication log for lines containing \u201cuser hoover\u201d.",
    "$ grep \"user hoover\" /var/log/auth.log",
    "pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user hoover by (uid=0)",
    "pam_unix(sshd:session): session closed for user hoover",
    "Note that this returns lines containing the exact match. This makes it useful for searches where you know exactly what you\u2019re looking for.",
    "## Regular Expressions",
    "A regular expression (or regex) is a syntax for finding certain text patterns within a file. Regular expressions are much more flexible than plain text searches by letting you use a number of techniques beyond simple string matching. They allow for a high degree of control, but constructing an accurate pattern can be difficult.",
    "For example, let\u2019s say we want to find authentication attempts on port 4792. Simply searching \u201c4792\u201d would match the port, but it could also match a timestamp, URL, or other number. In this case, it matched an Apache log that happened to have 4792 in the URL.",
    "$ grep \"4792\" /var/log/auth.log",
    "Accepted password for hoover from 10.0.2.2 port 4792 ssh2",
    "74.91.21.46 - - [06/Jun/2019:19:44:32 +0000] \"GET /scripts/samples/sear",
    "To prevent this, we could use a regex that only returns instances of 4792 preceded by \u201cport\u201d and an empty space. We do this using a technique known as positive lookbehind. Our expression looks like this (the -P flag indicates we\u2019re using the Perl regular expression syntax).",
