  "description": "# SQL Injection\n\n> SQL Injection (SQLi)  is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. SQL Injection is one of the most common and severe types of web application vulnerabilities, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary SQL code on the database. This can lead to unauthorized data access, data manipulation, and, in some cases, full compromise of the database server.\n\n## Summary\n\n* [CheatSheets](https://github.c",
