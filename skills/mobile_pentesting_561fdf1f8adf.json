    "When dealing with an app's IPA or an installed app on a jailbroken device, finding `.entitlements` files or the `embedded.mobileprovision` file directly may not be possible. However, entitlements property lists can still be extracted from the app binary, following the procedures outlined in the \"iOS Basic Security Testing\" chapter, particularly the \"Acquiring the App Binary\" section.",
    "Even with encrypted binaries, certain steps can be employed to extract these files. Should these steps fail, tools such as Clutch (if compatible with the iOS version), frida-ios-dump, or similar utilities may be required to decrypt and extract the app.",
