    "When a **PHP** engine receives a **POST request** containing files formatted according to RFC 1867, it generates temporary files to store the uploaded data. These files are crucial for file upload handling in PHP scripts. The `move_uploaded_file` function must be used to relocate these temporary files to a desired location if persistent storage beyond the script's execution is needed. Post-execution, PHP automatically deletes any remaining temporary files.",
    "> [!TIP]",
    "> **Security Alert: Attackers, aware of the temporary files' location, might exploit a Local File Inclusion vulnerability to execute code by accessing the file during upload.**",
    "The challenge for unauthorized access lies in predicting the temporary file's name, which is intentionally randomized.",
    "### Exploitation on Windows Systems",
    "On Windows, PHP generates temporary file names using the `GetTempFileName` function, resulting in a pattern like `<path>\\<pre><uuuu>.TMP`. Notably:",
    "- The default path is typically `C:\\Windows\\Temp`.",
    "- The prefix is usually \"php\".",
    "- The `<uuuu>` represents a unique hexadecimal value. Crucially, due to the function's limitation, only the lower 16 bits are used, allowing for a maximum of 65,535 unique names with constant path and prefix, making brute force feasible.",
    "Moreover, the exploitation process is simplified on Windows systems. A peculiarity in the `FindFirstFile` function permits the use of wildcards in Local File Inclusion (LFI) paths. This enables crafting an include path like the following to locate the temporary file:",
