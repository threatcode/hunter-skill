The intent is evidence-driven review (no fuzzing or blind scanning), keeping Burp as the source of truth.",
    "## Architecture",
    "- **Burp MCP Server (BApp)** listens on `127.0.0.1:9876` and exposes intercepted traffic via MCP.",
    "- **MCP proxy JAR** bridges stdio (client side) to Burp's MCP SSE endpoint.",
    "- **Optional local reverse proxy** (Caddy) normalizes headers for strict MCP handshake checks.",
    "- **Clients/backends**: Codex CLI (cloud), Gemini CLI (cloud), or Ollama (local).",
    "## Setup",
    "### 1) Install Burp MCP Server",
    "Install **MCP Server** from the Burp BApp Store and verify it is listening on `127.0.0.1:9876`.",
    "### 2) Extract the proxy JAR",
    "In the MCP Server tab, click **Extract server proxy jar** and save `mcp-proxy.jar`.",
    "### 3) Configure an MCP client (Codex example)"
