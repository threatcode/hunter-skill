    "- **Neighbor Advertisement (NA)**: Unicast responses to NS or spontaneous announcements.",
    "IPv6 also incorporates special address types:",
    "- **Loopback Address (`::1`)**: Equivalent to IPv4's `127.0.0.1`, for internal communication within the host.",
    "- **Link-Local Addresses (`FE80::/10`)**: For local network activities, not for internet routing. Devices on the same local network can discover each other using this range.",
