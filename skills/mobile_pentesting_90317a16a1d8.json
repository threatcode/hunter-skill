    "**There are two layers:**",
    "- The **OS**, which keeps installed applications isolated from one another.",
    "- The **application itself**, which allows developers to **expose certain functionalities** and configures application capabilities.",
    "### UID Separation",
    "**Each application is assigned a specific User ID**. This is done during the installation of the app so t**he app can only interact with files owned by its User ID or shared** files. Therefore, only the app itself, certain components of the OS and the root user can access the apps data.",
    "### UID Sharing",
    "**Two applications can be configured to use the same UID**. This can be useful to share information, but if one of them is compromised the data of both applications will be compromised. This is why this behaviour is **discourage**.\\",
    "**To share the same UID, applications must define the same `android:sharedUserId` value in their manifests.**",
    "### Sandboxing",
    "The **Android Application Sandbox** allows to run **each application** as a **separate process under a separate user ID**. Each process has its own virtual machine, so an app\u2019s code runs in isolation from other apps.\\",
    "From Android 5.0(L) **SELinux** is enforced. Basically, SELinux denied all process interactions and then created policies to **allow only the expected interactions between them**.",
