    "- SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is the standard protocol for sending emails across the Internet.",
    "- It has mechanisms for both authentication and encryption to enhance security, and DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) is an additional layer of email security.",
    "### SMTP Authentication",
    "SMTP Authentication is a process that allows a client to log into an SMTP server to send email by providing a username and password. This process ensures that the email sender is authorized to use the server. There are several methods for SMTP authentication, such as:",
    "1. **PLAIN**: Sends username and password in clear text (can be secure if used with SSL/TLS).",
    "2. **LOGIN**: Similar to PLAIN but sends username and password as base64 encoded strings.",
    "3. **CRAM-MD5**: A more secure method where the server sends a unique challenge string and the client responds with a hash of the username, password, and challenge.",
    "### SMTP Encryption",
    "SMTP servers use encryption to secure email contents during transmission. Two common methods are:",
    "1. **STARTTLS**: This command upgrades a plain text connection to an encrypted connection using TLS (Transport Layer Security). It's not a separate protocol but a way to secure existing SMTP connections.",
    "2. **SSL/TLS**: A direct method where the connection starts as encrypted using SSL/TLS. It's often used on different ports (like 465 for SMTPS).",
    "### DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)",
    "DKIM is an email authentication method designed to detect email spoofing. It allows the sender to claim responsibility for a message in a way that can be validated by the recipient. Here's how it works:",
    "1. **Digital Signature**: The sending mail server attaches a unique DKIM signature header to the email. This signature is created using a private key only known to the sender's domain."
