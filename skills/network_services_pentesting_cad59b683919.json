    "LDAP directories are structured to allow their distribution across several servers, with each server housing a **replicated** and **synchronized** version of the directory, referred to as a Directory System Agent (DSA). Responsibility for handling requests lies entirely with the LDAP server, which may communicate with other DSAs as needed to deliver a unified response to the requester.",
    "The LDAP directory's organization resembles a **tree hierarchy, starting with the root directory at the top**. This branches down to countries, which further divide into organizations, and then to organizational units representing various divisions or departments, finally reaching the individual entities level, including both people and shared resources like files and printers.",
